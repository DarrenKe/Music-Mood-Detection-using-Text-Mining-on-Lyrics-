 First off let me say you look so tired...
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky...
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight
So drop the gown the game's over just push your face into the fight and it breaks my heart like dancing up all night ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong like nothing we've ever...
Felt before

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes tonight
Baby you can have it
Baby you can have it

Ooh baby gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star...

Of my every last show
Let's go for a long ride I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
The stranger's candy, broken alleys
Tonight we could bring it all down we could bring it all down

They think this body's a dead note dancing to the beat but they'll never see this corpse coming 'till it kills them Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin? sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city?
In the city?

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city
In the city
In the city
In the city

Ain't no love If you ever make it back to Nashville
Remember you have still got a friend
I'll meet you at the Parthenon
That's the place we always went

It's been so dull since you left Nashville
I've read the same books again &amp; again
It makes me wish I wasn't bashful
When it comes to other men

But if I could have my way
Darling you'd come home

Remember when you moved to Nashville
And the first time that we kissed
Remember when your mother found us
Remember that you're sorely missed

And when you make it back to Nashville
We'll forget all of your sins
And I still buy two pairs of everything
So when you come home you &amp; I'll be twins

Because if I could have my way
I wouldn't be alone I'm driving home for Christmas
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Well, I'm moving down that line

And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time
But I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me

Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lotta people already know excatly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm goin down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin nothin but (claimin my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm livin
I do as I please, you see 
A younger brother that's up on reality
Cause everybody knows you have to be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton

(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)

(Where you from, fool?) 
(Compton)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see 
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively 
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win 
Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n 
Kick it

(Born and raised)

Hell muthafuckin yeah

Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know I might have just flown
Too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"

Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
Some hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was a turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"

Sometimes it's really just like the movies

Dreams can still be nightmares too

A fatal attraction to cuteness
Style is style
Fashion is fashion
Girl, you got style Hips sway and lips lie
Like clockwork she's in control of all the right guys
And I'm still waiting, fitted hats and a car alarm
In her high-tops with her favorite song
She's showing off the way she walks, it's on

Take me, show me (Whoa, whoa)
The corners of your empty room
The trouble we could get into
Just fake it for me (Whoa, whoa)
Disregard the footsteps and we'll never tell a soul

Tonight I'm finding a way
To make the things that you say
Just a little less obvious

I walk a fine line
Between the right and the real

Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love?
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stayed
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale Hit it

Homegirls inside just let your nature rise

Now Gabby got the verbal that'll get your little wifey out her girdle
In a session with me lightin' up a little herbal
Turtle shell
School individuals that listen to me
Word it well
Given to the rapper who is livin to be heard and held
In a high esteem
I get you drunker than your bourbon, ale, liquor, malt, my assault learned it well
Turn the tables of time with my perception
Building staples of rhyme hear my reflections
"on a little" life I'm livin in a universe with no beginning to it
So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin into infinite subliminably spirited
A nigga with a "clip and send it rip         "
Indigenous stork has just touched ground
Rappers organizations get shut down
Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed
But rap its like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead
I be the G-I-F-T test me hefty left's be gettin' swung
Cruise like a jet ski
Up in yo apartment and plop on your couch y'all
Undisputed heavyweight lyrical southpaw

[Chorus]

It's like a lime to a lemon-that rhymes, I assemble them
At times when I'm "  " they shine you remember
"  " divine forces "  " that refine men &amp; women &amp;
I rhyme for a livin', not just for the scrilla man
That isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout
Uzi mc's I have arguments n' fallin' outs wit'
About what it's all about, ain't about foamin out the mouth
Like a walkin tall can of Guinness Stout
"        "
When the battle cries soundin'
Ding-ding, hit 'em like, bing-bing
Eat 'em like, B-King, yet wit' no seasoning-bee sting
Wich yo girl dressed in a g-string she's swingin'
My way shorty and it sure looks good
I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should
I be the jack of trades, rappers pray
That I don't decapitate, after they cash his ass
Is that an irate? Great!
Grade-A, top-choice lyricism
Hey, hit me wit' that shell shocked rhythm
One time fo' the funky rhymes I say
Two times for the beat and for my DJ
It don't stop

[Chorus]

I say we drop it on a (one), we drop it on a (two)
We comin' out (fresh), and we do it (for you)
You know the deal with Blackalicious, we don't play

For the new "millie", rain like a shower
Let it seep in your pores (??)
Oh lord that's [scratch]
Rock ya from the top and to the bottom (from the bottom to the top)
(cause I grab the mic) wit the intent to get ill
A natural that you know who is (still Mrs. Field's)
So slide to the side and (take it light) and (throw your hands in the air) all night (party people in the place...)
I make 'em suffer, to the fallen mc's I'd be the (quicker pickem upper) (galactic of a nebula)
I'm rappin the spectacular, attackin whack amateurs n' back stabbin salamanders
Creepin while I'm peepin on 'em (party time)
Before I used to hit the meetings it was (Thunderbird wine) (used to drink the Ole)
Now I drink Calistoga, sober and I'm older
But the world is still gettin colder (colder)
The Gift of Gab don't stop (the way I feel I have just got to rock)

It's getting late
I'm making my way over to
My favorite place
I gotta get my body moving
Shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah
Who knew
That you'd be up in here, looking like you do
You make and staying over here, impossible

Looking out over the multitude
Looking in to the heart of it
Reaching out into the middle of it
Seeing how we\'re a part of it

Chorus:
I\'m feeling the tides of time
Moving in on my senses now
I\'m feeling the tides of time
Pull me in, pull me out

Could be in the sun setting
Might be in the rise of a storm
Could be in the morning light
Must be in the moment you\'re born

Seems like human nature
Seems like the day to day
Seemed like a big hay ride
Started us out to find our way

Unofficial verse:
So hard so beautiful
Rushing out over eternity
So long that\'s the short of it
So short that\'s the long and the tall of it Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
Yo Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they? Can they, Hop?
I spit it through the wire, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man (For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all)
I'd gladly risk it all right now (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
It's a life-or-death situation, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now
It's your boy Kanye to the, Chi-town, what's goin' on? (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Uh huh, yeah, yeah

Kanye West:
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support?
Telling her her son's on life support and just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
I really apologize for everything right now, if it's unclear at all, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
Y'know he had reconstru- I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
I looked in the mirror and half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man, this what I got to say right here, dawg (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

Kanye West:
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I, I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
Y'know what I'm saying? (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!" Haha (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
She can't be serious, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
(Right down to the wire, even through the fire)

Chaka Khan:
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit
Through the fire, through whatever
Through the fire, to the limit We've got our feet on the wire, talking 'bout flying
Maybe we're diving in over our heads
Scared of what I'm feeling
Staring at the ceiling here tonight

Come on lay down these arms, all our best defenses
We're taking our chances here on the run
The fear is an anchor, time is a stranger
Love isn't borrowed, we aren't promised tomorrow

We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
For the perfect time to come
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready

Where we don't know, though we can't see
Just walk on down this road with me
Won't be steady, never be ready

You're okay, you're with me here in the silence
With all of the violence crashing around
Saying we can't go, saying we don't know
This road that is narrow is the one we should follow

We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
For the perfect time to come
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready

Where we don't know, though we can't see
Just walk on down this road with me
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready

Steady my hands, this one can turn around
Steady my heart, it's beating faster
Steady my hands, this one can turn around
Steady my heart, it's beating faster, beating faster now

We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
For the perfect time to come
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready

Where we don't know, though we can't see
Just walk on down this road with me
Won't be steady, never be ready

Won't be steady, never be ready
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready
Won't be steady, never be ready Everybody's doing a brand new dance now

A feeling so much stronger than
A thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul
It can't be bought
Your mind can wander

Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo! (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know

I can't stand the beats
I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus round her neck

Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something

I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel, kneel
Yeah... I wanna tell you a little story about a party that went all right but went all wrong
I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was "Spaz", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
"I should have one last party at my place..."
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
"You're invited to my House Destruction Party!"

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

LET'S GO!

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, "I wanna speak to someone who lives here!" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, "Is this the condition the house has always been in?"
She answered, "Uh... yeah, it is."

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

LET'S GO! HEY... DEL made a pact to be well natural
Back from the wishing well to sell actual
Funk from the fungus grown in the trench
It's getting kinda heavy so I gotta pinch an inch
And it's a snitch

To let my hair grow like a plant
Eliminate the fat gold chains and the diaper pants
Trade 'em for a pair Girbauds
Never make friends with the fraudulent foes

Yes I suppose that I'm fat from the supper
Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty
Now I got to flip on a copper like a penny
Vise uh versa, quench your thirst

With a swig of grapefruit juice straight from the thermos
Hock your jewels, and you can drop your tools
And make a move that can turn us in the right direction
Show your affection as I correct men

Who try to pull the wool over the third eye
Comin' fly with Mr. Greenjeans
It's a bird eye view of the meadow
As I greet the many people that I meet with a hello

"How do you do my compadre?", What up Kwame?
Back to the Meadow so I can show I'm a
Smooth black brother that is gifted
And if you try to lift this, yes, I got a witness
Nicknamed the Emperor, this wasn't meant for ya'

Ya little crumbsnatcher (What do your nipples look like?)

Wherever I go
I take a little piece of you
I collect
I reject
Photographs I took of you.

Well towns I passed through
So many faces
So many places
I have got to have a memory
I have never been there
I have never been there
I have never had you... (repeating)

Memorabilia...

Keychains and snowstorms

Memorabilia Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching the sunset- I'll never forget
Watching all the reds, and oranges slip away-
Letting go of yet, another dirty day

Breathing in the fumes from so many ideling cars
right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
watching the sun go down--

Watching    the    sun    go  down----- Well I was born an original sinner
I was borne from original sin
And if I had a dollar bill for all the things I've done
There'd be a mountain of money piled up to my chin, hey

My mother told me good, my mother told me strong
She said, "Be true to yourself and you can't go wrong.
But there's just one thing that you must understand.
You can fool with your brother
But don't mess with a missionary man.
Don't mess with a missionary man
Don't mess with a missionary man
Don't mess with a missionary man."

Oh, the missionary man, he's got God on his side
He's got the saints and apostles backing up from behind
Black eyed looks from those Bible books
He's a man with a mission, got a serious mind

There was a woman in the jungle and a monkey on a tree
The missionary man, he was following me
He said, "Stop what you're doing, get down upon your knees.
I've a message for you that you better believe."

Ah yeah
Hey
Uh
Hey, uh

Well I was born an original sinner

Nobody else but you baby Woke up in the middle of the night cold sweating
Ass stinging no breath legs clinging to the bedside

Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right

This situation's gotten out of control
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Listen

Got burnt by women poor dirts? In Venice
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

As you turn your face right back to me
What the hell do you know you say
Like some righteous man better than me
Well, I'm down, and you're killing me
And I'm down, but still you mean nothing to me

What the hell do you know you say
As you try to shrink me to your size
What the hell do you know you say
Just because you're scared to try
Well, I'm down, and you're killing me
And I'm down, but still you mean nothing to me

Here we go, singing the same song you've heard a thousand times
You think you know the answer

It's the same damn song you've heard a thousand times
'Cause I'm down, and you're killing me
Yeah, I'm down, and you're killing me

When you're down, well, I'll walk away
When you're down... but still you mean fuck-all to me
Yeah, nothing to me You're a ticking clock in a timeless land
Holding on too long without any hands
And the stars are falling down around you now
In the rain there are wonders left to touch
So you're reaching out

Hold on to me while I
Hold on to my Father's hand
(God will heal you, make you, like new)
Time will bring you to
My Father's hands

So the flowers grow and bloom in the desert sand
And the crystal tears they fall and flower in a barren land
'Til you feel the sunlight shining on your skin
and all that once was lost in you is alive again She said, "Andy what you doing on the mountain?"
She said, "Now, Andy, what you doing on the air?"

When something's covered
Does it just go away?
Or does it just hover
Behind the veil of today?

And she said, "You don't,"
"You don't have any houses."
And he said, "No, you don't,"
"You don't have any home"

So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario

Ayo, Bo knows this (what) and Bo knows that (what)
But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax and let yourself go
Don't front what you heard, but act like you know

Yes yes, y'all (yes y'all)
Who got the vibe, it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all)
Real live, y'all (live y'all)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that) Brown
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
(Contact) Can I get a hit (hit)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow how now wow how now, Brown cow
We're ill till the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario

(True blue) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of seashore
Ship-shape crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes, baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, and -eader, simply just a leader
Bass in the space means peace, see ya later
Later (later), later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflator
So yo, the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound (ooh)

It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked
Then they rebuked, then you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact (boom) from the cannon
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh, uh, all over the track, man
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Roar, roar, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (uh) the rhymes are on time (time)
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, motherafucka

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario Even when the world is grey 
I go where I wanna go, I'm OK 
Rainy skies don't cloud my mind 
I do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do 
I don't know anything but I 
say what I wanna say, say what I wanna say 

Know that I want you 

The sky in my mind is always blue 
In my world the sun shines from you 

Often I know I don't see 
The waves of love that wash over me 
Your love is a paradigm 
For a man just looking for the next cheap rhyme 
Visualizing paradise is a 
thing I don't wanna do, a thing I don't wanna do 

But I know that I want you 

The sky in my mind is always blue 
In my world the sun shines from you 

Life traces the line in space between 
What's gone and what's gonna be 
Time chases me, my mind races 
To find the place where I wanna be 

The sky in my mind is always blue 
In my world the sun shines from you 

Know that I want you 
Know that I want you (end) Everybody wants to be a showman 
Yeah they all got another one 
Everybody think they got a genius 
Everybody got me on the run 
Sometimes I think they come here 
Just so you can say that you can 
And I can't get alone in my bathroom 
I need to give myself a hand 

Y'all cuh-cuh-cuh-creepin' 
Creepin' underneath my skin 
Fuck you and your flashbulbs 
Snappin' my picture again 
You drink all my whiskey 
You steal all my smoke 
And you're crowded all around me 
Like I got nowhere to go 

(Chorus) Eyes are gonna roll
Beggin' me to kill
Time for you to go 
I'm-a-gon' spill 
It ain't yo fast train 
I'll be the king runnin' at the wheel 
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here no 

You keep stickin' to me like a prickly porcupine 
You're gettin' your information from the grocery checkout line 
Are ya true confessin' of your little girl obsession
Cuz I was only messin', an' I had a little time 
Chorus... Chorus X2 Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day

Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love

I cry from heaven above.
This time can only be kept...
by those who never have wept.
It's strange these things that we're told.
Live fast and never grow old.
Live fast and die in your shoes
the devil, the devil, may choose.

Heeee, liii Heee, liii.

Keep up with wishes of sin.
Your life will never begin.
Cleanse now the scum in your soul.
Out the lies, the lies you've been told.
These things can always be found...
ind arkness, always in doubt.
Look up, don't age with content.
Get strong and go deep within.

Heee, liii. Heee, liii.

You say, you're falling in love.
Cry for shelter from heaven above.
Release the sin that lives in your heart.
Let the devil cry out in the dark.
Lifestyle is taking its toll.
Let yourself go just lose all control.
Just 'cause you know you are bored.
Don't you fall down upon your own sword.

I was making love last night
To a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step
'Cause she come ev'ry time that she pirouettes over me

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping

I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in, flush out and fire the fuckin' feed

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off)

Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene
It's all mesmerized all that inside me

The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows moonlight mystery

Headed for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off, get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off, get them off)

I need to find time
Someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait

It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

Now I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hangin' on
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waitin'
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Keep on waitin'
Until that day
But it ain't easy yeah
It ain't easy
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take The stone taht the builder refused
Will always be the head conerstone
The stone that the builder refused
Will always be the head cornerstone

You're a builder, oh, la di la
Here I am a stone
Don't you think and refuse me
Cause the things people refuse
Are the things they should refuse
Do you hear me, hear what I say

The stone taht the builder refused
Will always be the head conerstone
The stone that the builder refused
Will always be the head cornerstone

I can be soft as a pillow
Weep like a willow
Caress and bring happiness
Don't refuse me, don't you refuse
Don't don't don't you refuse Ooh, baby
Anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you

'Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

I just get
More attached to you when
You hold me in your arms and squeeze me
And you leave me, makin' me blue

'Cause then I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

So in love (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
With you (so in love)
Baby (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
Hee (so in love)
With you (so in love)

When I think of you (when I think of you)
When I think of you (when I think of you)

Hahahaha
Feels so good
When I think of you
Yeah, yeah
Baby There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love

The space between
The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be

The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again
Will I hold

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between 
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go

The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

The space between
Our wicked lies is
Where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Love is all we need dear

The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you

The space between
In your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time

The space between
