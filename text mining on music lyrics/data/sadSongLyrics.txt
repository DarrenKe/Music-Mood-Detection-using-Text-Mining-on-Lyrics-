 We're in the building where they make us grow
And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers
Like you

My mallory heart
Is sure to fail
I could crawl around the floor
Just like I'm real
Like you

The sound of metal
I want to be 
You
I should learn to be man
Like you

Plug me in
And turn me on
Oh everything is moving here

I need my treatment
It's tomorrow they send me
Singing "I am an American"
Do you?

Picture this
If I should make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall!
Did you?

And who are you?
And how can I try?
Here inside I like the metal
Don't you?

All I know, is no one dies
I'm still confusing love with need It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine?

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Play all my records, keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for awhile
Till Johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Oh, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Oh, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to Cool breeze and autumn leaves
Slow motion daylight
A lone pair of watchful eyes
Oversee the living
Feel the presence all around
A tortured soul
A wound unhealing
No regrets or promises
The past is gone
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
And go high like the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high
Hooo
Free to fly tonight
Free to fly tonight When you say it's dead and gone
Yes, I know you're wrong
Cut and slash, sharpest knife
It won't die
Poison cup, drank it up
It won't die
No fire, no gun, no rope, no stone
It won't die

Why you gotta shove it in my face
As if you put me in my place?
'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
Ain't gonna spend another night
In your bed
In your bed

Laws of man are just pretend
They ain't mine
Love so good, love so bad
It won't die
Some talk too long, they know it all
I just smile and move on

Words ain't free, like you and me
I don't mind

Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel?
The dogs are loose, I'm on to you
You ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk
Can't call it leavin', 'cause it's just
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came And I....

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, Im sorry. 
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl. 
I know you put all your trust
in me, I'm sorry I let you down. 
Please forgive me girl.

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe, in the spirit of love
it can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please
Come home


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee Waiting
To be born again
Wanting
The saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away

Nothing
Is what I feel
Waiting
For the drugs to make it real
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away

Waiting
To be disciplined
Aching
For your nails across my skin
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Summer's dying Master of disharmony
welcome my tainted soul
Take me from the hordes of the living
into the blessed darkness
Master of disharmony
take my impure flesh
Lead me into the path of temptation
save me from cowardness

Save me from cowardness

Master of sin
take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
for I am the damned

Master of death
take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain

Master of sin
take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
for I am the danmed

Master of death
take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain Buy now, I kill for a living
Buy now, I kill for a living…

I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score
This is what you have been killed for
Dancing on the kill floor

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
to sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

regulations or safety tips

Eligible bachelors

Cuz we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Out here where I've been spinning
It's nearly impossible to slow down
One night of your company
Might be the only thing to keep me sane

Don't turn me away don't turn me away

I need you now I need you now don't turn away

That's when she turned to me and said
"I'm not sure anymore..."

And now, amidst the waves and the cloudless skies
That'd blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore

Have you ever been a part of something 
That you thought would never end
And then of course it did?
Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin
And then something had to give?

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
There's always something in this everchanging life
And there probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by
The same arguments are always on our mind
We've killed this slowly fading light

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

And now something 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me 
If i'm already gone

Well now something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now let's say that something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now that we
Make the same mistakes, we're always hanging on
Break those promises we're always leaning on
All this time spent waking up
I keep this line open to get this call from you 
Speak the words
That keep me coming back to you
Now this time it's all different

Now something has kept me here too long 
And now I'm gone... Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know
It's been comin' for some time

When it's over, so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know
Shinin' down like water

El tictac de los relojes
Y sigo pensando en ti

Everyday, I think of you. 
I think a bit more of you 
I take apart my heart... 
Something in me is destroyed... 
Everyday I think of you. 
I think a bit more of you... 
Everytime that the sun comes out 
I look for a bit of valor 
to continue. 


And I see you, I didn't touch you that way. 
I pray for you every night... 
It dawns and I think of you. 
And it rumbles in my ears 
the tick-tock of the clocks

Yes

Eleanor, put those boots back on
Kick the heels into the Brooklyn dirt
I know it isn't dignified to run
But if you run, you can run
To the Coney Island roller coaster
Ride to the highest point
And leap across the filthy water
Leap until the Gulf Stream's brought you down
Mm-hmm

I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land

So, Eleanor, take a Greenpoint three-point turn
Towards the hidden sun
You know you are so elegant when you run
Oh, if you run, you can run
To that statue with the dictionary
Climb to her fingernail and leap
Yeah, take an atmospheric leap
And let the jet stream set you down
Mm-hmm

Could be there when you land
I could be there when you land
Could be there when you land

So, Eleanor, put those boots back on
Put the boots back on and run and run
Come on over here
Come on over here
Come on over here
Mm Nevermind the face you put on
In front of me
Nevermind the pain
That you've put me ..through

And every little thing you say
And every little thing you do
Makes me doubt all of this

Chorus:
Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted this to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me

Nevermind the trip that you've been on
Or so it seems
Nevermind the lies you told, not truths

And every little thing you said
And every little thing you did
Made me doubt all of this

So you too can be among the living dead

You know I need it

Some fresh blood and flesh

Please forgive for me wrong
My desire is umm so strong
I can not help it I have to obey

Some fresh blood and flesh The breath of the morning, I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement

High up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be all right
All right
I'm all right
All right

I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

Uptight Bury your head
Bury your head

I was feeling fine
You'll be coming clean tonight
And I'll be falling down with you once again
Call me your valentine, call me once tonight
And haven't said that it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them
The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come on to it
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, the idle thing

Bury your head
Has the child smashed you down
And the psalms will never call me again
(Fall down below)
I'll sleep tonight
(when you're okay)
And I haven't said it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them
The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come on to it
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, the idle thing

They will been the ones who'll see it all
This is what you call love?!

They stole my life
Sold right and all
They wandered around and round my mouth,
They stole my life
Sold right and all
(Stole it all)
They have been the ones who've seen enough

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come on to when
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, the idle thing

You'll be coming clean tonight... So, I lost my head a while ago
But you seem to have done no better

We, we set fire in the snow
It ain't over, I'm not done

Some do magic
And some do harm
I'm holding on, holding on
I'm holding on to a straw

Who is the Alpha
And what is made of cloth
How do you say you're sorry and there's nothing
to be afraid of?

Is it dark already
How light is a light
Do you laugh while screaming
Is it cold outside?

One thing I know for certain
Oh I'm pretty sure
It ain't over
I'm not done What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper (deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in dispair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming,
Begging pleading no more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause i
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh

I'm about to break
And I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights

(Ooh)
(Ooh)

Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced, and we both started groovin'
She said, "I dig you, baby, but I got to keep movin' on, keep movin' on"

Last dance with Mary Jane
One more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in
And I'm tired of this town again

(Ooh)
(Ooh)

Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

Oh, my my, oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

Last dance with Mary Jane
One more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in
And I'm tired of this town again

There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
Nightfall will be comin' soon

Oh, my my, oh, hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number, I walked to the road

Last dance with Mary Jane
One more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in
And I'm tired of this town again

(Ooh)
(Ooh) This could be the very minute
I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home

With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps
As a child of 25

This is the straw
Final straw in the
Roof of my mouth
As I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time

You're the only thing that I love
Scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer

Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth, I'm lost for words

What have I done?
It's too late for that
What have I become?
Truth is nothing yet
A simple mistake starts the hardest time
I promise I'll do anything you ask
This time Frozen in the place I hide
Not afraid to paint my sky with
Some who say I've lost my mind
Brother try and hope to find

You were always so far away
I know that pain so don't you run away
Like you used to do

Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can

You were always so far away
I know that pain
So I won't run away like I used to do

Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste

You were always so far away
I know the way so don't you run away
Like you used to do If I ever leave you....you can say I told you so!
And if I ever hurt you  baby..... you know I hurt myself as well.

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think I want his little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't making to much money
You know where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to  baby
And I never spent one red cent

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think he  wants his little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know

A part of you that no one else could see

I just wanna hear,a hear ya say

Mother that man took my soul away
Father how could you ever treat me this way
Brother don't let him do this again
This time it's over I'm gonna make it end
Now it's over and the old man is in
Lying on the ground bullet in his head

She stood at the foot of the guilty bed last night
She held what she said for the rest of her life
She did all what see said she is gonna do
She's through, she's through, she's through, yeah

Mother that man took my soul away
Father how could you ever treat me this way
Brother don't let him do this again

Now it's over and the old man is in
Lying on the ground bullet in his head

There's a bullet in your head
I kept falling down, I kept falling down
I kept crying out, I kept crying out
I keep falling down, I keep falling down
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

Now it's over, this is what she said
He's lying on the ground bullet in his head On some blue, light-green fields
On a long, leaking road
I confess there's no course
That could lead me to you

Pictures of her
In those booklets
Crawling in my head
Trolleys, madness 
Songs of coastguards
Can't relieve my speed I'm not alone
I wish I was
Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now

I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all

I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

Where is the fighting man?
Am I he?
You would trade every truth
For hollow victories

And every empire will fall
Every monument crumble
Forgotten men who watch, who watch the centuries

Whose silent words rise up
Rise up in betrayal
And we will rise up
Rise up in betrayal

Where is the fighting man?
Am I he?
You would trade every truth
For hollow victories

Every empire falls

The lands of my birth

And these are the lands, the lands of my birth
Soon to be ruins, ruins of my past
And when the sky should fall
The Earth to ashes turn
Then you will know they shall be my tomb

Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

She says "Days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire"

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again! I dream about, how it's gonna end
Approaching me quickly
Living a life of fear
I only want my mind to be clear

People, making fun of me
For no reason but jealousy
I fantasize about my death
I'll kill myself, from holding my breath

My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My, suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too

Help me, comfort me
Stop me from feeling what I'm feeling now

My, suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too

Dreamin' about my death, dream

Too many choices
In New York I found a friend
To drown out the other voices

Voices on the cell phone
Voices from home
Voices of the hard sell
Voices down the stairwell
In New York, just got a place in New York

In New York summers get hot
Well into the hundreds
You can't walk around the block
Without a change of clothing

Hot as a hairdryer in your face
Hot as a handbag and a can of mace
New York, I just got a place in New York
New York, New York

In New York you can forget
Forget how to sit still
Tell yourself you will stay in
But it's down to Alphaville

Irish, Italian, Jews and Hispanics
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew
Living happily not like me and you
That's where I lost you New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In New York I lost it all
To you and your vices
Still I'm staying on to figure out
My midlife crisis

I hit an iceberg in my life
But you know I'm still afloat
You lose your balance, lose your wife
In the queue for the lifeboat

You got to put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In the stillness of the evening
When the sun has had its day
I heard your voice whispering
"Come away, child"

New York, New York Waking up I see that everything is okay
The first time in my life and now it's so great
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great

I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliance
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

I found a place so safe, not a single tear
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Feel calm, I belong, I'm so happy here
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere

I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliance
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry

This innocence is brilliant (it makes you want to cry)
This innocence is brilliant
Please don't go away
'Cause I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by (it's so beautiful it makes you want to cry)

This innocence is brilliant (it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful)
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now (it makes me want to cry)
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by Hey, was that you floating past the tree line?
Hey, was that a feather in your hand?
No, I don't mean to ask these questions
No, I don't mean to rush your heart
I swear I saw this accidentally
No, I don't mean to start

Hey, the rain falls straight into the sidewalk
Hey, the clouds hang heavy in the sky
But I don't want to still believe in
The gravity of solid ground
The world below is not so big
That it can keep us down

We are standing on the rooftops
We are circling like sparrows
We are tiny, we are trembling
Scared of everything
But the heart is still a red wing

Fly above the houses and the schoolyards
And fly until you cannot feel the Earth
No, I don't mean that it's so easy
I don't mean that it's so small
But the world below is not so mean
That it can make us fall

We are standing on the rooftops
We are circling like sparrows
We are tiny, we are trembling
Scared of everything
But the heart is still a red wing

Do-do-do
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Do-do-do
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Shut your eyes and think of somewhere
Somewhere cold and caked in snow
By the fire, we break the quiet
Learn to wear each other well

And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
Yeah, our secret space, at will

Shut your eyes, I'll spin the big chair
And you'll feel dizzy, light and free
And falling gently on the cushion
You can come and sing to me

And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
Yeah, our secret space, at will

Shut your eyes

I don't eat no meat.
No dairy, no sweets.
Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily,  to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
and, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
cause you dont want to loose - vitamins and minerals 
and that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable , so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy .
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.
That's why we gotta start takin better care of ourselves.

Be Healthy Ya'll.

come as you are We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Patrón on the brain
Ball player in her face
They shake the spot
She's just another cake

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

He steady with a flock of 'em, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (won't care), all you do is keep me at home
Won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home
I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers
In the jacket pockets
Chicks calling the house non-stop
It's getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs
Saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Easy for a good girl to go bad

We gone forever
We gone forever Notice me, take my hand 
Why are we strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me? 

Every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I make believe that you are here 
It's the only way I see clear 
What have I done? 
You seem to move on easy 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 

At night, I pray 
That soon your face will fade away 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby If we're the flagship of peace and prosperity
We're taking on water and about to fuckin' sink
No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew all left the passengers to die under the sea

Countdown, to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

State of the union address
Reads war torn country still a mess
The words: power, death, and distorted truth
Are read between the lines of the red, white, and blue

Countdown, to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

Your place in hell
Your place in hell

'Guilty' is what our graves will read
No years, no family, we did
Nothing (nothing) to stop the murder of
A people just like us You're comin' tonight
To my home town
I've been to yours many times before
And it's always been a thrill

You'll stay in a hotel
Or at friends near by
We haven't spent the night together in this town
Since nineteen seventy nine
Not such a long time

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird

Have a drink after the show
I might really want to know
But everything you say I oppose
I blame it on my hole
It's just my role

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird

I spend my time trying to forget you
With booze and smoke from cigarettes and dope
I only seem to forget myself
It's only you that is left

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
I can steal a melody
This I am allowed
You would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird
It'd be weird, it'd be weird

You're comin' tonight
To my home town I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
It's been so long I've lost my taste
Say angel come, say lick my face
Let fall your dress
I'll play the part
I'll open this mouth wide, eat your heart

I can hardly wait...
Lips cracked dry
Tongue blue burst
Say angel come, said lick my thirst
It's been so long I've lost my taste
Here romeo, make my world as great

In my glass coffin I'm waiting
In my glass coffin I'm waiting
In my glass coffin I'm waiting... The day's last one-way ticket train pulls in 
We smile for the casual closure capturing. 
There goes the downpour 
Here goes my fare thee well

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
‘Cause I'm already gone

There's only so many words that we could say 
Spoken upon long-distance melody. 
This is my hello 
This is my goodness

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
‘Cause I'm already gone

Maybe in five or ten yours and mine will meet again 
Straighten this whole thing out. 
Maybe then honesty need not be feared as a friend or an enemy 
But this is the distance 
And this is my gameface

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
Is there really no way to reach me
Am I already.....

So this is your maverick 
And this is Vienna Time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

Now you always say
That you want to be free
But you'll come running back (said you would baby)
You'll come running back (I said so many times before)
You'll come running back to me

Oh, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

You're searching for good times
But just wait and see
You'll come running back (I won't have to worry no more)
You'll come running back (spend the rest of my life with you, baby)
You'll come running back to me

Go ahead, go ahead and light up the town
And baby, do everything your heart desires
Remember, I'll always be around
And I know, I know
Like I told you so many times before
You're gonna come back, baby
'Cause I know
You're gonna come back knocking
Yeah, knocking right on my door
Yes, yes

Well, time is on my side, yes it is
Time is on my side, yes it is

'Cause I got the real love
The kind that you need
You'll come running back (said you would, baby)
You'll come running back (I always said you would)
You'll come running back, (won't have to worry no more) to me

Yes time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Oh, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
I said, time, time, time is on my side, yes it is
Oh, time, time, time is on my side
Yeah, time, time, time is on my side Will you think of me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind
I wanna say your name
But the pain starts again
It's never my luck so never mind

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault.
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
But I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven

Will you wait for me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind
I've lost a lot of what I don't expect to ever return
I tend to push them till the pushing's turned from hurt into burn
I always take them to that place they thought they wanted to go
Then end up dancing round, this clown commands applause at his show

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
A somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven

I can only dream of you and sleep but I'd never see sunlight again
I can try to be with you, but somehow I'll end up just losing a friend
I can only reach for you, relate to you, I'm losing my friend
Where did she go? Where?

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
I stood outside her heaven

Would you let me in your heaven?
I wanna live inside your heaven We'll do it all
Everything 
On our own

We don't need
Anything 
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world? You try this trick and spin it
Yeah (yeah)
Your head will collapse
And there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind

Way out
In the water, see her swimming

I was swimming in the Caribbean
The animals would hide behind the rocks
Except the little fish
When they told me east is west
As they tried to cry

Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind

Way out
In the water, see them swimming

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
And there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind

Way out
In the water, see her swimming

(With your feet on the air and your head on the ground)
(Try this trick and spin it, yeah) Where, oh, where have you been, my love?
Where, oh, where can you be?
It's been so long since the moon has gone
And, oh, what a wreck you've made me

Are you there over the ocean?
Are you there up in the sky?
Until the return of my love
This lullaby

My hope is on the horizon
Every face, your eyes I can see
I plead and I pray through each night and day
Our embrace is only a dream

And as sure as days come from moments
Each hour becomes a life's time
When she'd left I'd only begun
This lullaby Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me.

So use it and prove it,
Remove this whirling sadness,
I'm losing, I'm bluesing,
But you can save me from madness.

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me.

So save me I'm waiting,
I'm needing, hear me pleading,
And soothe me, improve me,
I'm grieving, I'm barely believing now, now.

When you are flying around and around the world,
And I'm lying and lonely,
I know there's something sacred and free reserved,
And received by me only.

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me.

So use it and prove it,
Remove this whirling sadness,
I'm losing, I'm bluesing,
But you can save me from madness, now, now.

When you are flying around and around the world,
And I'm lying and lonely,
I know there's something sacred and free reserved,
And received by me only.

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile.

Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it,
But you've got a secret,
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it,
But you've got a secret.

Nobody knows it, (use it) nobody knows it, nobody knows it,
But you've got a secret,
Nobody knows it, (I'm bluesing) nobody knows it, nobody knows it,
But you've got a secret.

Nobody knows it, (use it) nobody knows it... Our people are poor, 
And you know damn well nobody wants to be poor
This play is gonna show how the pigs react when the people start
To take community, control over what belongs to them
And liberate it back (echoes)

Sometimes I just don't care

(Verse 1)
Murderation, modern hanging education
Price of your life is goin up it aint inflation
Incrimination, they got my picture at the station
Elimination, state to state we eatin by this nation
Them belly full, my trigger finger got pulled
To cut the bull shots'll warm your flesh like wool
These tools for survival make fools out of rivals
Fuck the Bible, get on your knees and praise my rifle
Your life is done there aint another place to run
Eat your own gun
scared because my people never known fun

(Verse 2)
Cops drive down the streets and blow my friends away
I try to smoke enough lah to take my sins away
This E&amp;J be freein us in it's own special way son
We live for the day, the only way done
The violence in me, reflect the violence that surround me
A truth thats riling
Mr. Charley keep his eye on me
To figure my head, but them ass kissin niggas is dead
We learn the chokeholds with fishermen's thread
I read The Art of Sun-Tzu in a couple of fuckin days
Used to practice Kung-Fu with this nigga that's like, double my age
And you can put this on the government's grave
Somebody payin for the way we have to suffer and slave
Assassination, word up

I hope they get the assassins, I hope that something is done to them
Problem is they're killing them, it reminds me of something like what
Happened to Lincoln

Chorus
You aint even safe wit a full clip
I swear on the president's grave
I'm sick of livin in this bullshit
We down to take it to the full length
Meet us up on Capitol Hill, and we can get up in some real shit
(repeat)

Assassination, *gunshot* yeah Your blood can tell you
All the others say

Arched waves of ceiling
Could stand outside the door

When the powers out and it's dark in the house
I will run
When the powers out and it's dark in the house
I will run

Run
Run
Run

Your blood reveals it
Reveals it
Reveals it
Reveals it
All the others say
All the others say
All the others say Aight, man, whatever...

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out

With all of this nonsense, it's constant

That song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses."

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black

Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razorblade shine Deep Green Dark Chaos
Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ahh...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn... This is where your sanity gives in
And love begins
Never lose your grip
Don't trip
Don't fall
You'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die
It lies deep inside
You can not hide
It's the meanest fire
Oh, it's a strange desire
You can not lie
That's a needless fight
This is where your sanity gives in
And love begins
Never lose your grip
Don't trip
Don't fall
You'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die
When your blood runs dry
You're paralyzed
It will eat your mind
Did you hold it back
It comes to you in slow attacks
It's the meanest fire Cold and frosty morning, there's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
And as the day was dawning, my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind

I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
Cos I need more time
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education, I can't find the words to say
With all the things caught in my mind

I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground

Me and you, what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong

So don't go away
Say what you say

So don't go away You consider me the young apprentice
Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger
I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turned into a shining band of gold

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Mephistopheles is not your name
I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
You will see it come to its fruition

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Devil and the deep blue sea behind me
Vanish in the air, you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
When you find your servant is your master

You'll be wrapped around my finger Remember me the way I was
The way I'd make you late for work
I had to hold you, just because

Remember you the way you'd wake me up
To love me once again
We were lovers, we were friends

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

Remember when, just to feel my touch
Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I was taking all the love you had to give
But I was too lost in life to know
That without my love in return you could not live
Now she gives the love I did not show 

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you
I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you!
I fucking hate you 
(Shut up)

I fucking hate you
(Shut up, shut up) You hear me so clearly
And see how I try
So you feel me, So heal me
And tear me apart

And I won't tell a soul
I won't tell at all
And do they have to know, do they have to know
About my Goodnight Girl

Caught up in your wishing well
Your hopes inside it
Take your love and promises

You make them last, make them last, make them last

Doesn't matter how sad

Old reason
Reflected in your eyes
You said you wanted me, hmmm

Caught up in your wishing well

You make them last
Caught up in your wishing well

Take your love and promises

You make them last I am bottled, fizzy water
And you are shaking me up
You are a fingernail running down the chalkboard
I thought I left in third grade

Now my only consolation
Is that this could not last forever
Even though you're singing and thinking
How well you've got it made

Who are you?
When will you be through?

Yeah, it's just a phase
It will be over soon
Yeah, it's just a phase
Yeah, it's just a phase

Call it women's intuition
But I think I'm on to something here
Temporaryism has been the black plague
And the Jesus of our age

I know that I sound opinionated
Maybe biased and quite possibly jaded
But sooner than later
They'll be throwing quarters at you on stage

Who are you?
When will you be through?

Yeah, it's just a phase
It will be over soon
Yeah, it's just a phase
And I'm wanting for it to be over soon

"Hello?"
"Hi, it's me, what's up baby? I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight, so don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Wait, wait, say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really droppin' out, I think my battery must be low. Listen, if you can hear me, we're goin' to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"
(Phone Hang-up)

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should have said, "No, someone's waiting for me..."
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years done, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry ("Hello...?")
Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry ("Hello...?")
Gotta go...

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go...!

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry

"Listen baby, I'm sorry

Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
We're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!" I open up my head inside
And find another person's mind
I'm gonna take this chance I've got
I'm underlying as we speak
Hiding my face among the weak
Some say the day is on the way

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me

Into the wild
Into the wild

On my way
See the change (Rearrange)

High above the serpentine
I cross below the well-worn lines
Entangled in a missing memory
A violent oversight
A formless order will give rise
To something some new world is here to seize

Into the wild
Into the wild

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like "Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, "Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that"
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (Oh)
Everybody has their private world, where they can be alone. (So)
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Spoken
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful. (So) I remember when you used to be mine
Way back when
I was too naive to love you right
But now if I only had the opportunity
I would do anything
Because my heart still believes

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

Its irrelevant to dwell in the past
I'm accountable for what went bad
And I mean that
But I keep on praying for another chance
Just to have you back
'cause I've grown
And I know how to be your everything

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

Oh, no it ain't over yet
I just can't accept the possibility
We were made for each other's arms
I know you're my destiny
We can't erase what was meant to be
Part of you and part of me
If we try one more time
Maybe somehow we'll survive

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Boy, maybe we could bring it back 
Maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back
To life

Maybe you could be mine again We left our homes behind, now we're following the wolves' trail
Through the deepest forests, beneath the stars we ride
I can see the moon glowing red like the blood of warriors
There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our passionate hearts
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!

Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind as a sign of war
Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return

Blood will spill and heads will fall
as the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
in the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!
We are sworn in the name of steel

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!
Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die

Woo the sleeping one, r' the crying one
H'-hviss my little one, r'-r' my crying one
Ligg-ligg my tired one, rura sleeping one

Touch a feal, you blind a must
Soft the skin of the warmest rust
Cause nothing blows in the faraway
I go away, go away past the hills, past the day
Touch a feal, you blind a must
Soft the skin of the warmest rust
Cause nothing blows in the faraway
I go away, go away past the hills, past the day Hmm, yeah yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now, don't bother 
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me 
From the man that I've become, oh yeah

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is tragical
So, help me 
I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother 
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me
From the man I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of
Show you the shape of my heart This is a crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Doubting, unsettling and turning around, wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live? I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard, it all falls apart at first touch

Watching the reel as it comes to a close, brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all, it's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give? Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach

This is the crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lives, wondering what will come next Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know, let me

To drink him away again
My heart stops cold in my chest
There he is in the back of the bar, looking his best

He passes me by and grabs a stranger's hand
He pulls her on the floor to dance
Oh no, I don't understand
He don't even know who I am

He's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me
He don't remember me

But I remember the smell of his cologne
And tonight he has it on
And I remember the feel of his skin
And I can't help but go back there again

No, he's just an old memory

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me

She's saying, "That's okay
Hey Baby, do as you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says, "There's no turning back"
She trapped me in her heart

Now I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My Baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"

Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin', "Baby I'm alright"

All dry and English slow

"Three long years and your favourite man
Is that any way to say hello?"
And you hold me
Like you'll never let me go
Like you'll never let me go

"Oh come on and have a drink with me
Sit down and talk a while"
"Oh I wish I could and I will!
But now I just don't have the time"
And over my shoulder as I walk away
I see you give that look goodbye
I still see that look in your eyes

So dizzy, Mr. Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the silly frilly things have to first get done
In a minute, sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June
Until later doesn't always come
Until later doesn't always come

It's so hard to think it ends sometime
And this could be the last
I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
To hold you
To hold you

But chilly, Mr. Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy, fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long
Until later

I should've stop to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I didn't, now it's all too late
It's over and you're gone

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you so much

But how many times can I walk away
And wish "if only"
How many times can I talk this way
And wish "if only"
Keep on making the same mistake
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
I wish "if only"
But "if only"
Is a wish too late Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong 
But now
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up 
When you fall? 
Who's gonna hang it up 
When you call? 

Who's gonna pay attention 
To your dreams? 
Yeah, who's gonna plug their ears 
When you scream? 

You can't go on
Thinking nothing's wrong
But now
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna hold you down 
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around 
When you break? 

You can't go on 
Thinking nothing's wrong
But now
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Oh, you know you can't go on 
Thinking nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight? Song sung blue
Everybody knows one
Song sung blue
Every garden grows one

Me and you
The subject too
The blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song
You sing them out again
Sing them out again

Song sung blue
Weeping like a willow
Song sung blue
Sleeping on my pillow

Funny thing,
But you can sing it with a cry in your voice
And before you know, it got to feeling good
You simply got no choice

Me and you
The subject to the blues now and then
But when you take the blues and make a song
You sing them out again

Song sung blue

Funny thing, but you can sing it with a cry in your voice

You simply got no choice Fallin' rain
Outside my window
But I'll live on I know
It's gettin' better every day

Soon the sun will shine through my window
When it's gonna come
You know I really couldn't say
Oh, but I know, it's gettin' better every day

Oh, it's gettin' better now
Every day
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm a hard workin' man doin all that I can
Tryin' to make ends meat
Just a makin' my way through this jungle today 
It's gettin' the best of me

But I know it's gettin' better
And a change is gonna come my way
Yes I know it's gettin' better
Better every day, oh ha yeah

Been a-changin' the scene if you know what I mean
Good things are comin' my way
Now I'm livin' my life and I'm doin' it right
Sun shinin' every day

I can feel it gettin' better
And a change is gonna come my way
Yes, I feel it gettin' better
Better every day

Now it's only gettin' better
And a change has finally come my way
Yes, it's only so much better
Uhh, gettin' better every day

Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gettin' better, oh every day
I feel it gettin' better
It's gettin' better
I'm gettin' better
I'm gettin better As I leave here today
Apartment 108
I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
but I know you always did your best
in the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
and say this prayer for you tonight,
because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know: 
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be, 
it's being content with who we are

Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are The California animal is a bear
Angeleno but the devil may care
Summer - time to talk to and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I'll take to you the movies there
We could walk through Leicester Square
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

London in the summertime
Call me now, use the satellite
London in the summertime
Cuss me out and it'll be all right

Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice is yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may, the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primirose Hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

London in the summertime
Call me now, use the satellite
London in the summertime
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right

Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
It's all right now
Call me now, use the satellite
It's all right
It's all right

Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right now
It's all right

The California flower is a poppy child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl, American man

London in the summertime
Call me now, use the satellite
London in the summertime
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

But everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is a queer

Every time I see him he smiles 
And tells me how well he is walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually

Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain

An everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
Go home to an empty apartment and call a best friend who is queer

Diamonds, roses, I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain, of pain I cried all the way to the altar
A smile was on my face
But tears were in my heart

Two hearts broken
And a third will soon falter
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Oh my darlin', now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Take a calendar and turn back all the pages
Take my life, turn back each day since I was born
I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I see the damage I have done

Oh, my darling, now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part Bat your eyes girl
Be otherworldly
Count your blessings
Seduce a stranger

What's so wrong with
Being happy?
Kudos to those who
See through sickness, yeah

Over and over and over and over
And ooh

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
"Don't ever let life pass you by."

I suggest we learn to love
Ourselves before it's made illegal
When will we learn? (When will we learn?)
When will we change? (When will we change?)
Just in time to see it all come down

Those left standing will make millions
Writing books on the way it should have been

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning (Warning)
"Don't ever let life pass you by."

Floating in this
Cosmic Jacuzzi
We are like
Frogs oblivious

To the water
Starting to boil
No one flinches
We all float face down

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning (Warning)
"Don't ever let life pass you by."
Pass you by

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh Listen when I say, when I say it's real
Real life goes undefined, why must you be so missable?
Everything you take makes me more unreal
Real lines are undefined, how can this be so miserable?

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away

Listen, I can't make, make a sound or feel
Feel fine, I kissed the lies, why must they be so kissable?
Listen as I break, break the fourth wall's seal
Gorgeous eyes shine suicide, when will we be invisible?

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
We burned away

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away

This is the fall, this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small
This is the fall, this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
We burned away

Under the summer rain, burn
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away
