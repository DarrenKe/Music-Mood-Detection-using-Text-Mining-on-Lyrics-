 First off let me say you look so tired...
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky...
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight
So drop the gown the game's over just push your face into the fight and it breaks my heart like dancing up all night ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong like nothing we've ever...
Felt before

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes tonight
Baby you can have it
Baby you can have it

Ooh baby gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star...

Of my every last show
Let's go for a long ride I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
The stranger's candy, broken alleys
Tonight we could bring it all down we could bring it all down

They think this body's a dead note dancing to the beat but they'll never see this corpse coming 'till it kills them If you ever make it back to Nashville
Remember you have still got a friend
I'll meet you at the Parthenon
That's the place we always went

It's been so dull since you left Nashville
I've read the same books again &amp; again
It makes me wish I wasn't bashful
When it comes to other men

But if I could have my way
Darling you'd come home

Remember when you moved to Nashville
And the first time that we kissed
Remember when your mother found us
Remember that you're sorely missed

And when you make it back to Nashville
We'll forget all of your sins
And I still buy two pairs of everything
So when you come home you &amp; I'll be twins

Because if I could have my way
I wouldn't be alone Let's get it started, in here...

In this context, there's no disrespect, so, when I bust my rhyme, you break your necks
We got five minutes for us to disconnect, from all intellect and let the rhythm effect
Obstacles are inefficient, follow your intuition, free your inner soul and break away from tradition

And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers

I could crawl around the floor
Just like I'm real
Like you

The sound of metal

You
I should learn to be man

Plug me in
And turn me on
Oh everything is moving here

I need my treatment
It's tomorrow they send me
Singing "I am an American"
Do you?

Picture this
If I should make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall!
Did you?

And who are you?
And how can I try?
Here inside I like the metal
Don't you?

All I know, is no one dies
I'm still confusing love with need When you say it's dead and gone
Yes, I know you're wrong
Cut and slash, sharpest knife
It won't die
Poison cup, drank it up
It won't die
No fire, no gun, no rope, no stone
It won't die

Why you gotta shove it in my face
As if you put me in my place?
'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
Ain't gonna spend another night
In your bed
In your bed

Laws of man are just pretend
They ain't mine
Love so good, love so bad
It won't die
Some talk too long, they know it all
I just smile and move on

Words ain't free, like you and me
I don't mind

Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel?
The dogs are loose, I'm on to you
You ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk
Can't call it leavin', 'cause it's just

I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock

Dancing on the kill floor

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
to sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number

Loved
Cuz I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars
This is what you have been billed for

Buy now,
I kill for a living
Buy now,
I kill for a living… It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know I might have just flown
Too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down
It's all in your mind"

Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
Some hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was a turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, "Everybody look down

The storm maker says it ain't so bad

My global position systems are vocally addressed
They say the Nile used to run from east to west

I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night sometimes

Pulling away inside your skin

I don't care what nobody says, no, I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk, but I love her like no other

And the doctor seems to say he don't know
Where we're gonna go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

She don't care what her momma says, no, she's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all I have to take 'cause taking's gonna shape me I'm moving to Tokyo
'Cause I'm tired of San Francisco
My contracts are finally void
And I am getting out
On houses and building tops
I swallow the beams and sun drops
If my echos could reach your ears
Then I could save my calls
What happens when I'm above
The east river when you are in love?
We're staring at all these lights
And I am going blind

Fill all of the Navy yards
With hard working security guards
'Cause the numbers are wearing off
My plastic access cards
How can I begin to say
I feel better off when we stayed
In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?
Content like a panda bear
Still breathing the fresh mountain air
I'll put on a diving tank
And sing when I inhale It's hidden well deep inside
You don't want me to tell you why
What means nothing to you
means everything to me

Assimilating tears to the floor
I don't know you anymore
Assimilating to the floor
I don't know you anymore

Come on crawl out of my head
Ammonite
What means nothing to you
means everything to me

Assimilating tears to the floor

Om du kunne se alt jeg kan se
I ensom majestet
Jeg lever i en synd
Svever på en løgn
Uten deg har jeg ingenting Run away from all your boredom. Run away from all your whoredom
And wave your worries and cares goodbye
All it takes is one decision. A lotta guts, a little vision
To wave your worries and cares goodbye

It's a maze for rats to try. It's a maze for rats to try
It's a race, a race for rats, a race for rats to die
It's a race, a race for rats, a race for rats to die

Sick and tired of Maggie's farm. She's a bitch with broken arms
To wave your worries and cares goodbye

Run away. Run away. Run away. Run away
Run away You ready, Nick?
Yes

Eleanor, put those boots back on
Kick the heels into the Brooklyn dirt
I know it isn't dignified to run
But if you run, you can run
To the Coney Island roller coaster
Ride to the highest point
And leap across the filthy water
Leap until the Gulf Stream's brought you down
Mm-hmm

I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land

So, Eleanor, take a Greenpoint three-point turn
Towards the hidden sun
You know you are so elegant when you run
Oh, if you run, you can run
To that statue with the dictionary
Climb to her fingernail and leap
Yeah, take an atmospheric leap
And let the jet stream set you down
Mm-hmm

Could be there when you land
I could be there when you land
Could be there when you land

So, Eleanor, put those boots back on
Put the boots back on and run and run
Come on over here
Come on over here
Come on over here
Mm Guess this means you're sorry, you're standing at my door
Guess this means you take back, all you said before
Like how much you wanted, anyone but me
Said you'd never come back, but here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Maybe I was stupid, for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for, trying to pick a fight

I know that I've got issues, but you're pretty messed up too
Either way I've found out, I'm nothing without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

Being with you, is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you, but I can't let you go, oh yeah

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me, and honestly
My life, would suck, without you Nevermind the face you put on
In front of me
Nevermind the pain
That you've put me ..through

And every little thing you say
And every little thing you do
Makes me doubt all of this

Chorus:
Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted this to be?
This life you gave away
Was meant for me

Nevermind the trip that you've been on
Or so it seems
Nevermind the lies you told, not truths

And every little thing you said
And every little thing you did
Made me doubt all of this

Chorus:
Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?

Yeahhhhhh

Oh was meant for me, yeah hey yeah hey

Oh No Oh I, I have this need
I need to see you bleed
I need to taste your brain
Oh god it drives me insane

Come, come over here my dear
Theres nothing for you to fear
I need a little piece of your head
So you too can be among the living dead

You know I need it
You know I feel it
You know I want it
Some fresh blood and flesh

Please forgive for me wrong
My desire is umm so strong
I can not help it I have to obey
You know i'll eat you if you choose to stay

Cause i'm an angel
Cause I'm am a devil
Cause I am a lost soul
Feeding off your flesh and blood

You are my angel
You are my lost soul
You are the one I need to kill my desire to feed

You know I need it
You know I feel it
You know I want it
Some fresh blood and flesh

(2x)
Cause I'm a girl
I am a zombie

I am a girl
I am a zombie girl

You know I need it
You know I feel it
You know I want it
Some fresh blood and flesh Bury your head
Bury your head

I was feeling fine
You'll be coming clean tonight
And I'll be falling down with you once again
Call me your valentine, call me once tonight
And haven't said that it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them
The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come on to it
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, the idle thing

Bury your head
Has the child smashed you down
And the psalms will never call me again
(Fall down below)
I'll sleep tonight
(when you're okay)
And I haven't said it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them
The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come on to it
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, the idle thing

They will been the ones who'll see it all
This is what you call love?!

They stole my life
Sold right and all
They wandered around and round my mouth,
They stole my life
Sold right and all
(Stole it all)
They have been the ones who've seen enough

They went back on us
(Closed eyes rolled back couldn't step it up)
I could know him to come on to when
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, the idle thing

You'll be coming clean tonight... So, I lost my head a while ago
But you seem to have done no better

We, we set fire in the snow
It ain't over, I'm not done

Some do magic
And some do harm
I'm holding on, holding on
I'm holding on to a straw

Who is the Alpha
And what is made of cloth
How do you say you're sorry and there's nothing
to be afraid of?

Is it dark already
How light is a light
Do you laugh while screaming
Is it cold outside?

One thing I know for certain
Oh I'm pretty sure
It ain't over
I'm not done What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper (deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in dispair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming,
Begging pleading no more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause i
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh

I'm about to break
And I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away This could be the very minute
I'm aware I'm alive
All these places feel like home

With a name I'd never chosen
I can make my first steps
As a child of 25

This is the straw
Final straw in the
Roof of my mouth
As I lie to you
Just because I'm sorry doesn't mean
I didn't enjoy it at the time

You're the only thing that I love
Scares me more every day
On my knees I think clearer

Goodness knows I saw it coming
Or at least I'll claim I did
But in truth, I'm lost for words

What have I done?
It's too late for that
What have I become?
Truth is nothing yet
A simple mistake starts the hardest time
I promise I'll do anything you ask
This time She says, I've got something to say
She knows what she says well change everything
She led through to many sleepless nights
She's crying, she's crying, she's crying

Mother that man took my soul away
Father how could you ever treat me this way
Brother don't let him do this again
This time it's over I'm gonna make it end
Now it's over and the old man is in
Lying on the ground bullet in his head

She stood at the foot of the guilty bed last night
She held what she said for the rest of her life
She did all what see said she is gonna do
She's through, she's through, she's through, yeah

Mother that man took my soul away
Father how could you ever treat me this way
Brother don't let him do this again
This time it's over I'm gonna make it end
Now it's over and the old man is in
Lying on the ground bullet in his head

There's a bullet in your head
I kept falling down, I kept falling down
I kept crying out, I kept crying out
I keep falling down, I keep falling down
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

Now it's over, this is what she said
He's lying on the ground bullet in his head On some blue, light-green fields
On a long, leaking road
I confess there's no course
That could lead me to you

Pictures of her

Crawling in my head

And I am my Fathers Son
And his deeds
Cannot be undone, be undone

And you trade in his blood
Writing your history
In the sacrifices of the dead

Where is the fighting man?
Am I he?
You would trade every truth
For hollow victories
For hollow victories

And every empire will fall
Every monument crumble
Forgotten men who watch, who watch the centuries

Whose silent words rise up
Rise up in betrayal
And we will rise up
Rise up in betrayal

Where is the fighting man?
Am I he?
You would trade every truth
For hollow victories
For hollow victories

Every empire falls
And the Earth to ashes turn
The lands of my birth
Shall be my tomb

And these are the lands, the lands of my birth
Soon to be ruins, ruins of my past
And when the sky should fall
The Earth to ashes turn
Then you will know they shall be my tomb

Where is the fighting man?
I am he!
You would trade every truth
For hollow victories

Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support?
Telling her her son's on life support and just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died

Kanye West:
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I, I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid

Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:

Just walk on down this road with me
Won't be steady, never be ready

You're okay, you're with me here in the silence
With all of the violence crashing around
Saying we can't go, saying we don't know
This road that is narrow is the one we should follow

Never thought I'd work it out
How could I have known it was ever about ya boy?

Now there's nothin' to say
'Cause there's no words
And we're not talkin' anyhow
You must have known I was never to doubt ya boy

If it was so fine, it was so good
Oh, you're unbelievable
All this time I've been livin' without ya boy
But not your lyin'

It felt so good, the world don't know
Now they'll never find out
How all these years she mustered beside ya boy
Don't forget that I

Was the one that ya found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

We're a waste of time
And if I know you
Learned long ago it's true
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

Go and explain, explain it again
Boy, that this all started
Found you lying in the arms of another girl
So stop your crying

Day after day, year after year
Far too long it lasted
You must have thought I was nothing without ya boy
Don't forget that I

Was the one that ya found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

We're a waste of time

And I can't find a way for you and I to go further on

I'm always learning things the hard, hard, hardest way

'Cause I was the one, that ya found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope you never, I hope you never get to

Tonight, if we learn
That the world's on fire
I guess I'll turn to you
I hope I never, I hope I never have to In New York freedom looks like
Too many choices
In New York I found a friend
To drown out the other voices

Voices on the cell phone
Voices from home
Voices of the hard sell
Voices down the stairwell
In New York, just got a place in New York

In New York summers get hot
Well into the hundreds
You can't walk around the block
Without a change of clothing

Hot as a hairdryer in your face
Hot as a handbag and a can of mace
New York, I just got a place in New York
New York, New York

In New York you can forget
Forget how to sit still
Tell yourself you will stay in
But it's down to Alphaville

New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York

The Irish have been coming here for years
Feel like they own the place
They got the airport, city hall, concrete, asphalt
They even got the police

Irish, Italian, Jews and Hispanics
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew
Living happily not like me and you
That's where I lost you New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In New York I lost it all
To you and your vices
Still I'm staying on to figure out
My midlife crisis

I hit an iceberg in my life
But you know I'm still afloat
You lose your balance, lose your wife
In the queue for the lifeboat

You got to put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In the stillness of the evening
When the sun has had its day
I heard your voice whispering
"Come away, child"

New York, New York Waking up I see that everything is okay
The first time in my life and now it's so great
Slowing down I look around and I am so amazed
I think about the little things that make life great

I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliance
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

I found a place so safe, not a single tear
The first time in my life and now it's so clear
Feel calm, I belong, I'm so happy here
It's so strong and now I let myself be sincere

I wouldn't change a thing about it
This is the best feeling

This innocence is brilliance
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by

It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming
It's the happiness inside that you're feeling
It's so beautiful it makes you want to cry
It's a state of bliss, you think you're dreaming

This innocence is brilliant (it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful)
I hope that it will stay
This moment is perfect
Please don't go away
I need you now (it makes me want to cry)
And I'll hold on to it
Don't you let it pass you by Hey, was that you floating past the tree line?
Hey, was that a feather in your hand?
No, I don't mean to ask these questions
No, I don't mean to rush your heart
I swear I saw this accidentally
No, I don't mean to start

Hey, the rain falls straight into the sidewalk
Hey, the clouds hang heavy in the sky
But I don't want to still believe in
The gravity of solid ground
The world below is not so big
That it can keep us down

We are standing on the rooftops
We are circling like sparrows
We are tiny, we are trembling
Scared of everything
But the heart is still a red wing

Fly above the houses and the schoolyards
And fly until you cannot feel the Earth
No, I don't mean that it's so easy
I don't mean that it's so small
But the world below is not so mean
That it can make us fall

We are standing on the rooftops
We are circling like sparrows
We are tiny, we are trembling
Scared of everything
But the heart is still a red wing

Somewhere cold and caked in snow
By the fire, we break the quiet
Learn to wear each other well

And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
Yeah, our secret space, at will

Shut your eyes, I'll spin the big chair
And you'll feel dizzy, light and free
And falling gently on the cushion
You can come and sing to me

And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until
You can imagine this place
Yeah, our secret space, at will

Shut your eyes

I don't eat no meat.
No dairy, no sweets.
Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily,  to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
and, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
cause you dont want to loose - vitamins and minerals 
and that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable , so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy .
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.
That's why we gotta start takin better care of ourselves.

Be Healthy Ya'll.

Ha

But I know there's somethin' I needed to say
When I was out now
Maybe you were better alone
I know I'll make it home

She told me sweet thang
Run a labour
In your shoes
Touch me till I follow in love
I wanna help her
Maybe we were better alone
I wanna show you how

And then we walked out
Make it made now

no one can tell 
what you say or do next 
are you blessed?
maybe by me sometimes 
come as you are We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Patrón on the brain
Ball player in her face
They shake the spot
She's just another cake

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

He steady with a flock of 'em, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (won't care), all you do is keep me at home
Won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home
I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers
In the jacket pockets
Chicks calling the house non-stop
It's getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs
Saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right

We gone forever
We gone forever Notice me, take my hand 
Why are we strangers when 
Our love is strong 
Why carry on without me? 

Every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I make believe that you are here 
It's the only way I see clear 
What have I done? 
You seem to move on easy 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby 

I may have made it rain 
Please forgive me 
My weakness caused you pain 
And this song's my sorry 

At night, I pray 
That soon your face will fade away 

And every time I try to fly, I fall 
Without my wings, I feel so small 
I guess I need you, baby 
And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, you're haunting me 
I guess I need you, baby If we're the flagship of peace and prosperity
We're taking on water and about to fuckin' sink
No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew all left the passengers to die under the sea

Countdown, to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

State of the union address
Reads war torn country still a mess
The words: power, death, and distorted truth
Are read between the lines of the red, white, and blue

Countdown, to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

Your place in hell
Your place in hell

'Guilty' is what our graves will read
No years, no family, we did
Nothing (nothing) to stop the murder of
A people just like us You're comin' tonight
To my home town
I've been to yours many times before
And it's always been a thrill

You'll stay in a hotel
Or at friends near by
We haven't spent the night together in this town
Since nineteen seventy nine
Not such a long time

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird

Have a drink after the show
I might really want to know
But everything you say I oppose
I blame it on my hole
It's just my role

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird

I spend my time trying to forget you
With booze and smoke from cigarettes and dope
I only seem to forget myself
It's only you that is left

I can steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me baby
I can steal a melody
This I am allowed
You would never sue me baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird
It'd be weird, it'd be weird

You're comin' tonight
To my home town I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
It's been so long I've lost my taste
Say angel come, say lick my face
Let fall your dress
I'll play the part
I'll open this mouth wide, eat your heart

I can hardly wait...
Lips cracked dry
Tongue blue burst
Say angel come, said lick my thirst
It's been so long I've lost my taste
Here romeo, make my world as great

In my glass coffin I'm waiting
In my glass coffin I'm waiting
In my glass coffin I'm waiting... The day's last one-way ticket train pulls in 
We smile for the casual closure capturing. 
There goes the downpour 
Here goes my fare thee well

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
‘Cause I'm already gone

There's only so many words that we could say 
Spoken upon long-distance melody. 
This is my hello 
This is my goodness

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
‘Cause I'm already gone

Maybe in five or ten yours and mine will meet again 
Straighten this whole thing out. 
Maybe then honesty need not be feared as a friend or an enemy 
But this is the distance 
And this is my gameface

There's really no way to reach me
There's really no way to reach me
Is there really no way to reach me
Am I already.....

So this is your maverick 
And this is Vienna Watch you when you say
What you are and when you blame
Everyone, you broken king
Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim
At the sum of everything

'Cause you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard

You lay there in the street
Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy, it's just so easy

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard

Oh and you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard

You draw so many lines in the sand
Lost the fingernails on your hands
How you're gonna scratch any backs?
Better hope that time will take our lines away
Take all our lines and

Hope that time will take our lines and
Hope that time will take our lines away
Take all our lines away Will you think of me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind
I wanna say your name
But the pain starts again
It's never my luck so never mind

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault.
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
But I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven

Will you wait for me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind
I've lost a lot of what I don't expect to ever return
I tend to push them till the pushing's turned from hurt into burn
I always take them to that place they thought they wanted to go
Then end up dancing round, this clown commands applause at his show

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
A somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven

I can only dream of you and sleep but I'd never see sunlight again
I can try to be with you, but somehow I'll end up just losing a friend
I can only reach for you, relate to you, I'm losing my friend
Where did she go? Where?

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
I stood outside her heaven

Would you let me in your heaven?
I wanna live inside your heaven There is nothing complicated

Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart
A feeling so much stronger than
A thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul
It can't be bought
Your mind can wander

Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo! (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know

I can't stand the beats
I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music
Swinging to the music
Oh...

Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo! (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something I can feel, feel

All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no-one gets hurt

Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo! (¿Dónde está?)
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something

I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel, kneel
Yeah... We'll do it all
Everything 
On our own

We don't need
Anything 
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told 
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

Let's waste time 
Chasing cars 
Around our heads

I need your grace 
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes; they're all I can see

I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world? You try this trick and spin it
Yeah (yeah)
Your head will collapse
And there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind

Way out
In the water, see her swimming

I was swimming in the Caribbean
The animals would hide behind the rocks
Except the little fish
When they told me east is west
As they tried to cry

Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind

Way out
In the water, see them swimming

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
And there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind

Way out
In the water, see her swimming

(With your feet on the air and your head on the ground)
(Try this trick and spin it, yeah) Where, oh, where have you been, my love?
Where, oh, where can you be?
It's been so long since the moon has gone
And, oh, what a wreck you've made me

Are you there over the ocean?
Are you there up in the sky?
Until the return of my love
This lullaby

My hope is on the horizon
Every face, your eyes I can see
I plead and I pray through each night and day
Our embrace is only a dream

And as sure as days come from moments
Each hour becomes a life's time
When she'd left I'd only begun
This lullaby I wanna tell you a little story about a party that went all right but went all wrong
I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was "Spaz", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
"I should have one last party at my place..."
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
"You're invited to my House Destruction Party!"

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

LET'S GO!

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, "I wanna speak to someone who lives here!" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, "Is this the condition the house has always been in?"
She answered, "Uh... yeah, it is."

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

LET'S GO! HEY... Our people are poor, 
And you know damn well nobody wants to be poor
This play is gonna show how the pigs react when the people start
To take community, control over what belongs to them
And liberate it back (echoes)

Sometimes I just don't care

(Verse 1)
Murderation, modern hanging education
Price of your life is goin up it aint inflation
Incrimination, they got my picture at the station
Elimination, state to state we eatin by this nation
Them belly full, my trigger finger got pulled
To cut the bull shots'll warm your flesh like wool
These tools for survival make fools out of rivals
Fuck the Bible, get on your knees and praise my rifle
Your life is done there aint another place to run
Eat your own gun
scared because my people never known fun

(Verse 2)
Cops drive down the streets and blow my friends away
I try to smoke enough lah to take my sins away
This E&amp;J be freein us in it's own special way son
We live for the day, the only way done
The violence in me, reflect the violence that surround me
A truth thats riling
Mr. Charley keep his eye on me
To figure my head, but them ass kissin niggas is dead
We learn the chokeholds with fishermen's thread
I read The Art of Sun-Tzu in a couple of fuckin days
Used to practice Kung-Fu with this nigga that's like, double my age
And you can put this on the government's grave
Somebody payin for the way we have to suffer and slave
Assassination, word up

I hope they get the assassins, I hope that something is done to them
Problem is they're killing them, it reminds me of something like what
Happened to Lincoln

Chorus
You aint even safe wit a full clip
I swear on the president's grave
I'm sick of livin in this bullshit
We down to take it to the full length
Meet us up on Capitol Hill, and we can get up in some real shit
(repeat)

Assassination, *gunshot* yeah Your blood can tell you
All the others say

Arched waves of ceiling
Could stand outside the door

When the powers out and it's dark in the house
I will run
When the powers out and it's dark in the house
I will run

Run
Run
Run

Your blood reveals it
Reveals it
Reveals it
Reveals it
All the others say
All the others say
All the others say Aight, man, whatever...

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses."

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am Wake up it's time
We need to find a better place to hide
Make up your mind
I need to know I need to know tonight

Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razorblade shine

Patience my dear
We could spend a lifetime waiting here
Maybe this time
I hope I get the chance to say goodbye

Sweet and divine
Razor of mine
Sweet and divine
Razorblade shine

Day after day
Cutting away
Day after day

It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights

You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me
Lets me know you're mine

I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man

Stare into my eyes

Boy don't be shy
Tonight's the night your fantasies
Will all come true
I am your woman
I belong to you

There is nothing I won't do for you
I know my soul connected me to you
I feel so safe when I'm alone with you
I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you
Baby I love making love to you
It's like a high I can't come down from you

I'd rather be with you
Because I love the way
You scream my name
And there's no other man
That gives me what I want
And makes me feel this way

I don't want nobody else
I ain't goin no where
I'm happy with you
You got me baby
I ain't thinking about
Nobody else but you baby Woke up in the middle of the night cold sweating
Ass stinging no breath legs clinging to the bedside

Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right

This situation's gotten out of control
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go
The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Listen

Got burnt by women poor dirts? In Venice
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

[Joyo Verlade]
We have a deep passion

Close relations past friendships don't last

These bad dreams She said, "Andy what you doing on the mountain?"
She said, "Now, Andy, what you doing on the air?"
And he said, "Andy doesn't live upon the mountain."
"If you're looking for Andy,"
"You'll be looking everywhere."

So don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
And don't call me Anne

When something's covered
Does it just go away?
Or does it just hover
Behind the veil of today?

And she said, "You don't,"
"You don't have any houses."
And he said, "No, you don't,"
"You don't have any home"

So don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy

So don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
No don't call me Andy
And don't call me Anne I'm not afraid of anything 
I just need to know that I can breathe 
I don't need much of anything 
But suddenly, suddenly 
I am small and the world is big 
All around me is fast moving 
Surrounded by so many things 
Suddenly, suddenly 

How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 

I am young and I am free 
But I get tired and I get weak 
I get lost and I can't sleep 
But suddenly, suddenly 

How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 

Would you comfort me? 
Would you cry with me? 

I am small and the world is big 
But I am not afraid of anything 

How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel 
To be different from me? 
Are we the same? 
How does it feel? 

How does it feel, how does it feel 
You're different from me, different When I grow up
I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels
That's what I'll do
Throwing out a boomerang
Waiting for it to come back to me

When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Waiting for it to embrace me oh I wish you could adore
The way you did before
Now you're living through another year
Oh, the light you were
Will soon become a blur
As you're living through another year

Oh, what a waste of time it is
To indulge inside of bliss
Getting ready for another year like this

Another year to lie
Another year goes by

You're not sick, so you can't heal
But I wonder do you feel
The need to cry: 'I'm out of here'
Oh, your goal is safe
But is it all you crave
As you're living through another year

Oh, what a waste of time it is
To indulge inside of bliss
Getting ready for another year like this

Another year to lie
Another year goes by

Is it me on how I see
The face of mediocrity
I try to smile you see
Your lightness darkens me
Filter all of your emotions
Fake you're never low
Or face the one you fear
You're living through another year

Another year to lie
Another year goes by
Another year to lie
Another year goes by Let's get it started, in here...

Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt, just fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God I feel so bound

So when I feel the need
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
A watch the blood
Hit the ground

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you

(Shut up, shut up) Even when the world is grey 
I go where I wanna go, I'm OK 
Rainy skies don't cloud my mind 
I do what I wanna do, do what I wanna do 
I don't know anything but I 
say what I wanna say, say what I wanna say 

Know that I want you 

The sky in my mind is always blue 
In my world the sun shines from you 

Often I know I don't see 
The waves of love that wash over me 
Your love is a paradigm 
For a man just looking for the next cheap rhyme 
Visualizing paradise is a 
thing I don't wanna do, a thing I don't wanna do 

But I know that I want you 

The sky in my mind is always blue 
In my world the sun shines from you 

Life traces the line in space between 
What's gone and what's gonna be 
Time chases me, my mind races 
To find the place where I wanna be 

The sky in my mind is always blue 
In my world the sun shines from you 

Know that I want you 
Know that I want you (end) Everybody wants to be a showman 
Yeah they all got another one 
Everybody think they got a genius 
Everybody got me on the run 
Sometimes I think they come here 
Just so you can say that you can 
And I can't get alone in my bathroom 
I need to give myself a hand 

Y'all cuh-cuh-cuh-creepin' 
Creepin' underneath my skin 
Fuck you and your flashbulbs 
Snappin' my picture again 
You drink all my whiskey 
You steal all my smoke 
And you're crowded all around me 
Like I got nowhere to go 

(Chorus) Eyes are gonna roll
Beggin' me to kill
Time for you to go 
I'm-a-gon' spill 
It ain't yo fast train 
I'll be the king runnin' at the wheel 
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here no 

You keep stickin' to me like a prickly porcupine 
You're gettin' your information from the grocery checkout line 
Are ya true confessin' of your little girl obsession
Cuz I was only messin', an' I had a little time 
Chorus... Chorus X2 I am bottled, fizzy water
And you are shaking me up
You are a fingernail running down the chalkboard
I thought I left in third grade

Now my only consolation
Is that this could not last forever
Even though you're singing and thinking
How well you've got it made

Who are you?
When will you be through?

Yeah, it's just a phase
It will be over soon
Yeah, it's just a phase
Yeah, it's just a phase

Call it women's intuition
But I think I'm on to something here
Temporaryism has been the black plague
And the Jesus of our age

I know that I sound opinionated
Maybe biased and quite possibly jaded
But sooner than later
They'll be throwing quarters at you on stage

Who are you?
When will you be through?

Yeah, it's just a phase
It will be over soon
Yeah, it's just a phase
And I'm wanting for it to be over soon

"Hello?"
"Hi, it's me, what's up baby? I'm sorry, listen, I'm gonna be late tonight, so don't stay up and wait for me, okay?"
"Where are you?"
"Wait, wait, say that again?"
"Hello?"
"You're really droppin' out, I think my battery must be low. Listen, if you can hear me, we're goin' to a place nearby, alright? Gotta go!"
(Phone Hang-up)

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?"
I should have said, "No, someone's waiting for me..."
But I called my girl up and said

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Now two years done, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!"

Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry ("Hello...?")
Listen, baby, baby I'm sorry ("Hello...?")
Gotta go...

Let me tell you the story 'bout the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, "Hi, I got a little place nearby"
Gotta go...!

"Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry

Say again? You're dropping out
My battery is low
Just so you know, we're goin' to a place nearby
We're goin' to a place nearby
Gotta go!" I open up my head inside
And find another person's mind
I'm gonna take this chance I've got
I'm underlying as we speak
Hiding my face among the weak
Some say the day is on the way

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me

Into the wild
Into the wild

On my way
See the change (Rearrange)

High above the serpentine
I cross below the well-worn lines
Entangled in a missing memory
A violent oversight
A formless order will give rise
To something some new world is here to seize

Into the wild
Into the wild

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like "Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, "Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that"
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (Oh)
Everybody has their private world, where they can be alone. (So)
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Spoken
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful. (So) I remember when you used to be mine
Way back when
I was too naive to love you right
But now if I only had the opportunity
I would do anything
Because my heart still believes

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

Its irrelevant to dwell in the past
I'm accountable for what went bad
And I mean that
But I keep on praying for another chance
Just to have you back
'cause I've grown
And I know how to be your everything

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life

Oh, no it ain't over yet
I just can't accept the possibility
We were made for each other's arms
I know you're my destiny
We can't erase what was meant to be
Part of you and part of me
If we try one more time
Maybe somehow we'll survive

Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make the dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Boy, maybe we could bring it back 
Maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back
To life

Maybe you could be mine again We left our homes behind, now we're following the wolves' trail
Through the deepest forests, beneath the stars we ride
I can see the moon glowing red like the blood of warriors
There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our passionate hearts
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!

Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind as a sign of war
Men, prepare for death, 'cause we might never return

Blood will spill and heads will fall
as the swords sparkle, lights the night
The ground rumbles as we attack
in the throes of rage, we will fight
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all!
We are sworn in the name of steel

Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell!
Into battle we ride with Gods by our side
We are strong and not afraid to die
We have an urge to kill and our lust for blood has to be fulfilled
WE'LL FIGHT TILL THE END! And send our enemies straight to Hell! Skar the fire son, pet the smiling one
Woo the sleeping one, r' the crying one
H'-hviss my little one, r'-r' my crying one
Ligg-ligg my tired one, rura sleeping one

Touch a feal, you blind a must
Soft the skin of the warmest rust
Cause nothing blows in the faraway
I go away, go away past the hills, past the day
Touch a feal, you blind a must
Soft the skin of the warmest rust
Cause nothing blows in the faraway
I go away, go away past the hills, past the day Hmm, yeah yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here, don't put out the glow
Hold me now, don't bother 
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me 
From the man that I've become, oh yeah

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful
Loneliness is tragical
So, help me 
I can't win this war, oh no

My heart stops cold in my chest
There he is in the back of the bar, looking his best

He passes me by and grabs a stranger's hand
He pulls her on the floor to dance
Oh no, I don't understand
He don't even know who I am

He's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me
He don't remember me

But I remember the smell of his cologne
And tonight he has it on
And I remember the feel of his skin
And I can't help but go back there again

Maybe the one you love isn't there
You're going under
But you're over it all so you don't care about all that I had to see
Watch you wait until you come around
Around So we meet again and I offer my hand
All dry and English slow
And you look at me and I understand, yeah it's the look I used to know
"Three long years and your favourite man
Is that any way to say hello?"
And you hold me
Like you'll never let me go
Like you'll never let me go

"Oh come on and have a drink with me
Sit down and talk a while"
"Oh I wish I could and I will!
But now I just don't have the time"
And over my shoulder as I walk away
I see you give that look goodbye
I still see that look in your eyes

So dizzy, Mr. Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the silly frilly things have to first get done
In a minute, sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June
Until later doesn't always come
Until later doesn't always come

It's so hard to think it ends sometime
And this could be the last
I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
To hold you
To hold you

But chilly, Mr. Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy, fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long
Until later

I should've stop to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I didn't, now it's all too late
It's over and you're gone

I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you so much

But how many times can I walk away
And wish "if only"
How many times can I talk this way
And wish "if only"
Keep on making the same mistake
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
I wish "if only"
But "if only"
Is a wish too late Gold is the sun
as she wonders where he's gone.
Far away, will they meet again one day?

Gold is the sun
as she wonders where he's gone.
Far away, will they meet again one day?

Future.
Future.
Future.

Gold is the sun
as she wonders where he's gone.
Far away, will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day?

Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day?

Future.
It's the a time to think.
Future.
It's a time to think.
Future.
It's a time to think about the past.

Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet?

Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day?
Will they meet again one day? You say you're falling in love.
I cry from heaven above.
This time can only be kept...
by those who never have wept.
It's strange these things that we're told.
Live fast and never grow old.
Live fast and die in your shoes
the devil, the devil, may choose.

Heeee, liii Heee, liii.

Keep up with wishes of sin.
Your life will never begin.
Cleanse now the scum in your soul.
Out the lies, the lies you've been told.
These things can always be found...
ind arkness, always in doubt.
Look up, don't age with content.
Get strong and go deep within.

Heee, liii. Heee, liii.

You say, you're falling in love.
Cry for shelter from heaven above.
Release the sin that lives in your heart.
Let the devil cry out in the dark.
Lifestyle is taking its toll.
Let yourself go just lose all control.
Just 'cause you know you are bored.
Don't you fall down upon your own sword.

Heee, liii. Heee, liii. Heeee, liii. He, l Ring the alarm

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know,

I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

You can't stay, you gotta go.
Ain't no other chicks spending your dough
This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine

Damn, if I let you go. As I leave here today
Apartment 108
I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
but I know you always did your best
in the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
and say this prayer for you tonight,
because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know: 
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be, 
it's being content with who we are

Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are Bat your eyes girl
Be otherworldly
Count your blessings
Seduce a stranger

What's so wrong with
Being happy?
Kudos to those who
See through sickness, yeah

Over and over and over and over
And ooh

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
"Don't ever let life pass you by."

I suggest we learn to love
Ourselves before it's made illegal
When will we learn? (When will we learn?)
When will we change? (When will we change?)
Just in time to see it all come down

Those left standing will make millions
Writing books on the way it should have been

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning (Warning)
"Don't ever let life pass you by."

Floating in this
Cosmic Jacuzzi
We are like
Frogs oblivious

To the water
Starting to boil
No one flinches
We all float face down

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning (Warning)
"Don't ever let life pass you by."
Pass you by

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh Listen when I say, when I say it's real
Real life goes undefined, why must you be so missable?
Everything you take makes me more unreal
Real lines are undefined, how can this be so miserable?

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away

Listen, I can't make, make a sound or feel
Feel fine, I kissed the lies, why must they be so kissable?
Listen as I break, break the fourth wall's seal
Gorgeous eyes shine suicide, when will we be invisible?

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
We burned away

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away

This is the fall, this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small
This is the fall, this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
We burned away

Under the summer rain, burn
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love

The space between
The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be

The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again
Will I hold

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between 
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go

The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

The space between
Our wicked lies is
Where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Love is all we need dear

The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you

The space between
In your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time

The space between
