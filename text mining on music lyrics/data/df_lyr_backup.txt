What you're feeling is pressure
Pulsate new blood

I've seen things you've heard never before
Bones aged in dust
Buy your bite, take the body

Calm, shutting down
You built me
I knew it

I'll never lie, liar
You fed me
I chewed it

I'll never lie, liar
I follow you, covering me
Spirits in pieces
Crumbled and burnt"
1	TRAAAAW128F429D538.h5	Casual	I Didn't Mean To	"Verse One:

Alright I might
Have had a little glare when I stared at ya ho
But I didn't know she was like that
She stared right back
My niggas warnin me that she was comin on to me
I react like a mack do I act cool
Just to test her cause I ain't no jester
I suggest her and her friend be outtie
Cause I don't want to make my pals get rowdy
And doubt me our friendship
But when lips touch
I go crazy in the clutch
Sorta like schitzo I forgets my bros and pals over gals
I didn't mean to but when you fiend you do
Strange things for the denim no matter who's in em
Grab a flooze then I'm in traffic
Don't laugh it might be your girl that I'm talkin about
I didn't mean to

Chorus: Repeat 2X

It ain't my fault that your girl got caught
It ain't my fault that your girl got caught (I didn't mean to)

Verse Two:

Another incident when I went
Way beyond what I should of done
John should of stopped before them drawers dropped
But I didn't ain't no quittin
Really didn't care who's girl I was hittin
I admit skinz ain't a reason to lose friends
But then again I didn't know, sorry
Accept apologies and live on
Are we goin hold grudges well oh fudge
Its a new year and I do fear
Ya actions ya actin shy
I mean ya need to be smackin
That hoe
Instead of tryin to front on me ya know
Thats exactly how I'm goin to be ya know
I run my game on any G ya know
Cause we the most entertainin
I meant to blame women
For makin me do what the Ak seem to
When you call I screen you
I didn't mean to

Chorus


Verse Three:

Why do fools be schememin dreamin
Actin like demons
Niggas don't give a fuck
Because they beat shit
To many girls front cute
When they want loot
They tell lies the swell guys
Can peep it and thats weak shit
Thats why I run game on every freak I get
Born in Oakland grew up pumpin Too Short
I know the rules on the flooze so who's short
I once had a ho who smoked blunts yo
She tried to get me so I looked at the front door
And now shes not with me so forget it
But every once in a while I'll hit it
And it happened to be your girl
I didn't mean to and I been through
Your relationship and I hate dumb dips
But I really can't trip when they ride my tip
I didn't mean to

Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl is a something girl
She's got something
Every girl is a something girl
Every girl has a somehing smile

For a while
If I had three wishes I know mine
I would not ask the stars to shine
I wouldn't ask for gems or pearls
I'd ask for the something girls
Every girl is a something girl
From the whites of her eyes
To the tip of a curl
Every girl sends a something boy
With that something
When this old world won't treat you right
You're not feeling yourself tonight
Think of someone you can do
Relax and let that something through
Every girl is a something girl
She's got she's got something"

I never mouthed those words away, I wouldn't cause concern

Someone is killing me

Turn him away, lay over there
His limb is red, I have all clear
Settle the wave I'm on my way
Dreaming of red, memories are worst

I feel abrasive worn and tired, don't think I could win
Take me to a place I adore and then seal me in
I'm not the one I swear I'm not, no matter how I felt
Die in a crossfire runaway, face the ash again

Leave a strange taste
Like french cigarettes
And these coloured drinks
That you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall
Well, I don't mean to complain
But it hurts just the same
And now both of us know
The leaves will fall on their own

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm goin' fast
I need love and it's you
And I feel like William Holden floating in a pool

Yea, you tell me
Life is for living
It's best in the giving
But it's so hard to be free
Still I do my best
But you refuse my gift
And now all that we share
Is a collection of tears

Just throw me a line
That's all that I ask
Well, it's sink or swim and I'm going fast
I need love and it's you

what cannot will be done
for every living thing under the sun
foggy color foggy race
just be one big happy face
among the sea of people
live among God's creatures sharing love

Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky...
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight
So drop the gown the game's over just push your face into the fight and it breaks my heart like dancing up all night ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong like nothing we've ever...
Felt before

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes tonight
Baby you can have it
Baby you can have it

Ooh baby gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star...

Of my every last show
Let's go for a long ride I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
The stranger's candy, broken alleys

Ain't no love

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin? sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city?
In the city?

Ain't no love

dismantle the will of a man
strip his flesh and bone

the moment comes
blade catches the light of your eyes

Nobody noticed
no one saw a thing
all turned a blind eye to the fallen
and the bad luck he brings

You wake in the morning after
the sky's a color that you can't see
friends have fallen by the wayside
why isn't anyone talking to me
get those funny looks in the market
people you loved just stare
wander on with your hands in your pockets
even your girlfriend don't care

They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor
They've all come to watch the emperor

To watch the emperor fall

One part truth
three parts deceit
two parts shit that you made up
add passion for heat

Did ya hear he said this
can you believe he done that
can you believe the nerve of the man
let me at him tell me where he's at
wake to your fave in the mirror
see someone you don't recognize
stare at the changes in the reflection
you've become someone that you despise"

More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I'll love you
The more I see you as years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

The more I see you the more I want you

With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

The more I see you as years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you

59	TRAAENC128F1451DE9.h5	Francis Dunnery	Too Much Saturn	"I always believed that if I ran off to India
Wore sandals and shaved my head
And used Body Shop conditioner, burned incense like crazy
I could call myself a spirit head
But I only went to India to look on top
I wore sandals 'cause I'd smoked all my money
And I shaved off all my hair 'cause I had the fleas
I'd been sleeping all over
And the Body Shop conditioner was a present from a friend
And the incense used to hide the smell
Of the drug den that I lay in

And so I ask myself what my motives are
For this lying need to look so free
And if I tell myself real honestly
What more can I admit to, open up a door
He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for
He said I'd find out soon
I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon

I always believed that if I never missed a Yoga class
Read my horoscope in the dailies
And recycle bottles, and know a Red Indian
I could call myself a spirit man
But I was only doing Yoga 'cause I fancied the teacher
And stars 'cause it looked good on paper
And I only went to church 'cause my granny gave me money
When confession was over
And I only knew the Indian 'cause his brother's a dealer
And the bottles had a price on their return
So I could go and play, Oh my my

And so I ask myself what my motives are
For this lying need to look so free
And if I tell myself real honestly
What more can I admit to, open up a door
He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for
He said I'd find out soon
I got too much Saturn and not enough Moon

So now that you know that I don't love you
And now that you see that I'm so scared
Am I a good man?
Am I a deep, deep man?

He said I'd find out soon

See the signs of a world
That's lost control

Stepping out my door
Isn't safe no more
But I know
It's where I want to go

Out where the thunder roars
Where the lightning strikes
On a distant shore
Out where the thunder roars
I'll stand in the heart of the storm
Where the thunder roars

If it was just me
I could never leave
And be a man
With his face turned to the wind

But I can go out there
Shake the hand of fear
Cause I'm walking
With the Mighty One

Who raised up His voice
To the storm
He'll keep us
Safe and warm

Out where the thunder roars
Where the lightning strikes
On a distant shore
Out where the thunder roars
I'll stand in the heart of the storm

Stand with my head held high
Be a voice of hope
With a lonely cry
Out where the eagles fly
The wonder of love will light up the sky

Out where the thunder roars
See it shine, a seal of time
Out...
Straight to the heart of the storm

The wonder of love
The wonder of love
The wonder of love
All the lonely people
All the needy people

Out where the thunder roars
Come to the heart of the storm
Out where the thunder roars
The wonder of love

Of love...

A lone pair of watchful eyes
Oversee the living
Feel the presence all around
A tortured soul
A wound unhealing
No regrets or promises
The past is gone
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
And go high like the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high
Hooo
Free to fly tonight
Free to fly tonight"

Yes, I know you're wrong
Cut and slash, sharpest knife
It won't die
Poison cup, drank it up
It won't die
No fire, no gun, no rope, no stone
It won't die

Why you gotta shove it in my face
As if you put me in my place?
'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
Ain't gonna spend another night
In your bed
In your bed

Laws of man are just pretend
They ain't mine
Love so good, love so bad
It won't die
Some talk too long, they know it all
I just smile and move on

Words ain't free, like you and me
I don't mind

Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel?
The dogs are loose, I'm on to you
You ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk
Can't call it leavin', 'cause it's just

I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came

Mad cause they sit on their ass just stagnating
Always vacillatin', now classmates I graduated with
Are wonderin' how the stupidest kid up in the class made it
Sick landscapin' and jammin' down in my mans basement
Getting restraints and complaints from mad neighbors
Now prejudice bigots say I sound just like them damn #@#
Them pair of lenses ain't repairin' their impaired vision
I'm on a mission escaping my own prison
Inflicting more pain then you're givin' see I'm my own victim
I can't believe I let you take up my time
Take up space in mind, give it here, I'm takin' what's mine

(Chrous)
The only ounce of power that I have 
Is what I do with now
And how I let the hours pass
I dont' know how long I'm gonna last
So I can't let ya snatch the powder out my hourglass

Everyday that I'm awake I face the angel of death
He may be taken my breath, so they can lay me to rest
And by now my inner state's the only place that I rep
The way that I dress is just another way to express
We know that some day everybody we see will be dead and rotten
Long forgotten, we oughta keep this for a normal topic
Because we all get caught up in all the drama
But what's the gossip gonna mean, when me and you are goners
See I never did audition for a part in this play
I know that some day I'll accidentally fall in my grave
So I can really give a shit about what all of ya say
According to me is how I'm spending all of my days

(Chorus)

The world will keep turnin', the inferno will keep burnin'
But it's affirmative my life on Earth is impermanent
And since I'm visiting and my minutes here are limited
I ain't havin' or doin' shit if I ain't feelin' it
I'll lend a hand to a hurt pedestrian and I will help a friend
In any way that I can, but I can't let man get up in the way of my plans
Make me stray from my path, I can't be takin' that chance

Eliminate top rappers, throw their remains insides of ditches

The very reason I'm able to strike so vicious

Allowing all Simeons to be freed thats locked down

You can handle the ball during a full-court press

Kneel to your master nigga, invoke the strongest emotion

Placed here to be the scum of the earth, serving us hand and foot

Now life for Ricans and Coons is homicidal
We Neo-Nazis seek nothing but world domination
God's plan is for us to seek and destroy man's false creation
It's exerted in the good book of Revelations
Set up to destroy spades and Jews from hidden stations
So my offspring's can end all this confusion for good
No more smooching off of welfare for jiggaboos in the so-called hood
Sickle cells decreasing your death rate, you black bitch
But I like the way you suck my wood
Germ grenades now in the form of A.I.D.S. were made to wipe you out

Of such an old lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you

So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday.

Though long ago,

Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart."

Huh, you tell me baby.

Saafir:Hey, it's like this man.
I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man.

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately.

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance cause they
ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man.

Verse 1:
You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline'
And stackin' your scratch
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin'
Stickin' and movin' slidin'
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner
Dodgin' the coroner's office
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin'
Shot callin'
It's the murk one like that
Sit back but not in starship
So I don't tarnish or rust
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

Hook: (x2)
What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball

Verse 2:
All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin'
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
&gt;From the trenches
The stench is unknown
I've been crawlin' like a two toed
Chameleon for so long
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick
Sickin' thinkin'
That we know it's on
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you
And you know they all with you
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes
Recognize
I'm crawlin'

Bridge: (x2)
Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin'
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone

But I see the anger in your eyes
I want what will not judge me
I need what keeps me warm inside

A man without a purpose
Stares from the mirror on the wall
You think you know my problems
I think that you don't know my at all

I don't believe I suffer
Disease as you proclaim
And I don't believe that I should kneel and hang my head in shame

Held prisoner by a monkey
Strapped on behind my back
And while I sit ablaze 
The light is slowly fading into the black
So I

I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again

Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
One more drink and I will be drowned

I know you hate to see me
As I defeat myself this way
You know you can't control me
You know I'm slipping day by day

Down into my obsession
Down in the hole where I belong
And when this fight is over
You will stay right here and I will be gone
So I

I've got to medicate myself again    3x

I found you broken 
And lying on the floor
An empty bottle in the drain
I put my hand right through the kitchen door

I've got to medicate myself again
Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
I barely get my coat off and you're already
Crawling down my back again
Yeah you get to watch me sinking down
One more drink and I will be drowned

I've got to medicate myself again"

You keep giving and never take away

I can give back to you
I'll worship you only, throughout eternity

Tell mommy I miss her since she went away 
I coming to see her real soon I hope 
He choked back a big lump that rose in his throat 

He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope 
To God up in heaven you'll get it I hope 
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail 
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale 

She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way 
And when she stepped out never looked either way 
A big auto hit her and sped away fast 
The little girls prayers had been answered at last 

The postman was passing and picked up the note 
Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke 
Straight up into heaven this letter did go 
She's happy up there with her mommy I know"

Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly

Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge

Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks

To unearth my earning potential

I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
preachy bootleggers will do away with you

Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

And for no extra charge

And get to the top of a mountain pinnacle

Just like the ocean, you're crashing against the well
All of the time, you're forgetting about yourself
Looking back after the facts
What have you left yourself?

Making love to every pretty gal they've met
Well up stopped a little sailor with his bright eyes all aglow
Saying take a look my gal's photograph
Then the sailors gathered round him just to look upon her face
And he said I love my Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby she's my treasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
And I love my little Filipino baby

In a little rustic cottage in the Port of Fillippines
Dwells a pretty little maiden all alone
And she's thinking of her true love though he's far off cross the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone
Then one day he whispered darling I've come back from Caroline
I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby..."

Lazin' out in the noonday sun.

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

When Tom was out of town,
She couldn't keep her dresses down.

People got to Emmie May
A-Tom took a gun in his hand
And stopped all the runnin' around.

Poor Tom, Seventh Son,
Gotta die for what you've done.

All those years of work are thrown away.
To ease your mind, is that all you can say?
But what about that grandson on your knee?
And then wrote songs as well as he could be.

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

285	TRAAWOR128F92DF3C8.h5	Sandi Thom	Wounded Hearts	"Just before I tell you standing in the rain 
I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again

So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my babys been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still dont know if Im a wounded heart.

Ive seen a lot of heartache and Ive walked a lonely road
They say the darkest times before the dawn
But the rooster hasnt crowed
And when you wake up in the morning
Oh my darling Ill be gone
 
Oh my babys been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still dont know if Im a wounded heart
No I still dont know if I'm a wounded heart.

So many fools fall in love
And its a crying game
Its a crying shame
That Im not a fool in love
But I know what Im feeling 
And my heart is still healing

Oh my babys been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
Oh I never wanted to be apart
But I still dont know if Im a wounded heart
No I still dont know if I'm a wounded heart."

When you were standing there 
Set in your way was that you were not blind 
You were sure to make a fool of me 
Cause there was nothing there 
That you could see 
That could go beyond your mind 
Now who's standing at the door 
Remembering the days before 
And asking please be kind 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I've set you free this time 

I have never been so far out in front 
That I could ever ask for what I want 
And have it any time 
Knowing this you found a thought for me 
That told you just what I should be 
And there I stood behind 
With all the ones that went before 
And memories that always seems to 
Tear me from my mind 
In front of what it is you seem me to be 
I've set you free this time 

I could never find a chance to choose 
Between a way to win or a thing to lose 
Because there was your stand 
On top of all the love you took 
There was only something 
You can look at lying in your hand 
Now who's wondering what has changed 
And why it can not be arranged 
To have each thing work fine 
It isn't how it was set up to be 
But I'll set you free this time"

Or just a moment's pleasure?

Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again

C'mon man - oh my fucking God man..
Oh shit, what the fuck did I do?
It's all my fucking fault man, it's all my fucking fault
Fuck man, fuck am I doing man, why man
Why God, why did you have to take her? Fuck..

(Sticky)
Why? Why? Why God why?
Everything I love always seems to die
Answer me, speak to me, I don't hear you
Answer me, motherfucker I ain't scared of you
Is there even a God? Do you even exist?
What I gotta do to speak to you slit my wrists?
I'm talking to a God that I can't see
Can you see me? Can you see me?

(God)
Are you confused my son, and scared?
Let me make things more clear, so you're more aware

(Sticky)
Fuck who was that all this shit is freaking me

(God)
It is I God did you not say you wanted to speak with me?

(Sticky)
Bullshit I am talking to myself, I'm going insane

(God)
You are talking to yourself we are one of the same

(Sticky)
It can't be it must be the drugs I'm high
And if you are then why are we born if we live to die?
Is there life after death? What were we before birth?
Why is this whole earth plagued and cursed?
Is killing a sin is there life in other planets?
Is adultery wrong did you write the ten commandments?

(God)
Excuse me my son, one question at a time
We were never born, and we will never die
In the essence, there Is no such thing as death
How could I write commandments and not have them kept?
The soul is eternal you just change form
Then you come back with a new face on
You can not limit love unless you lack understanding
To answer you yes there is life in other planets
The futures a mystery the past is history
Today is a gift that's why it is called the present
Life is so simple unless you make it confusing
The wise ones stand us and the clever we are using

(Sticky)
Wait - God, there is so much I want to ask you
God, God? Where are you? God I need to talk to you

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God

(Sticky)
Tell me, are there psychics that can speak telepathically?

(God)
Yes but if you use more than one tenth of the minds capacity

(Sticky)
I can't think I feel life going down the drain
In the streets everywhere I am surround in pain

(God)
Don't think, your thoughts are just that- thoughts
Your feelings will really erase what you been taught
Feelings are the language of the soul the soul is truth
I speak through you to aware the youth

(Sticky)
But why let the suffering go on why not just stop it?

(God)
In order for anything to exist, so much is opposite
How can there be left if there was never right?
How can something know death if it never knew life?
How can you lose, if nobody won?
How can it be dark if there was never a sun?
That which is not grandeur, the soil still blessed
Form must exist for part of themself to manifest

(Sticky)
But I never asked to be born, I hate my life
And if you are God dammit then show me the light
And tell me- what's the meaning of life?

(God)
The process of all life
is an ongoing, never-ending process of recreation of self

(Sticky)
Is God a he or she is there one true religion?

(God)
I'm the Alpha, the Omega, the beginning and ending
We are all one and everything is living

(Chorus)
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God, exactly what would you say?
If you could talk to God"

Tonight...
The stars are aligned and the planets colliding
And the plan is arriving and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
Your parents are goners, no children to mourn
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
These bombs are our babies and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of your rival
The pimps and the rise of your pulse, where you'll find her
Hey hey 

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse One - Lupe Fiasco)
Disease, the virus is spreadin' in all directions
No safe zone, no cure and no protection
No symptoms to find, the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies and no corrections
Quarantine your dreams and sever all connections
Don't let 'em in not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and wants you to have it next and
Don't accept 'em if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit, some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war 
Invented by the press just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
""Whores,"" say the nuns, ""nuns,"" say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientists say, ""it only infects the mind""
The little boy said, ""it only infects the girls""
The preacher man said, ""it's gonna kill off the soul""
A bum said, ""it's gonna kill the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her finger
Streets are on fire tonight

(Verse Two - Lupe Fiasco)
Believe! Some say the neon signs by the loud speakers repeatin' that everything is fine
A subtle silence to demolish the trouble conscience of accomplished with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted from the masses to the masses from the antennaes on top of the shrines
Was fine and received and planted during the panic and surely it reports back everything in your mind
Everything is lyin', everything is dyin'
Everying is a rule, everything is a crime
Everything was here then everything rewind
New weather burned the feathers off everything flyin'
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit, the lavish, the fastest, the clashes
The ashes to ashes, everything intertwined
My femme fatale, my darlin' fallen angel
Once caught her changin' the batteries in her halo
Receipt for wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
The scientist said, ""she's already inside my mind""
The little boy said, ""what happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said, ""she's gonna kill off the soul""
The dope boy said, ""it's the whole wide world""

(Chorus - Matthew Santos)
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue
And danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight"

My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt
They're hard to find in the states, got me feeling couture (it's really cool)
What's that you got on? Is it Comme des Garçons?
Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong, mixed up with second-hand clothes

Flipped the landscape when Nigo made A Bathing Ape

Your underground culture, visual grammar
The language of your clothing is something to encounter
A Ping-Pong match between Eastern and Western
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection?
Just wait 'til you get your little hands on L.A.M.B.

Well, just what makes you think it's all for the best?
Do you care, can you feel the pain?
Two billion people being starved for your gain

It seems that growth never keeps us with need
Too many mothers got too many mouths to feed
Damned if we do, we'll be damned if we don't
Things have to change and we all know that they won't

Will things get better?
Well, who can tell?
But if this is Heaven
Then show me Hell!

Build swords from plowshares, squeeze blood from a stone
And when they've used you, you'll be left on your own!
There seems no hope as we race towards the fall
The war machine will consume us all

Violence and bloodshed, the folly of man
They call it progress, I call it a scam
Push blindly forward without asking why
The rich gets richer, the poor can all die!

Will things get better?
Well, who can tell?
But if this is Heaven

All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

Whoever is on the front line is gettin' struck first
We mercinaries, fuck turf
Every verse is varied, I bust first
Mayday, Natural Elements controllin' the ship
Rollin' a spliff that'll probably put my soul in a twist
But I remain bonin' a bitch
Got her buck-naked posin' for flicks
Actin' like she was never known for the shit
But I look over the shoulder and see the enemy lookin'
Physically strong but mentally shooken
And for penetentiary bookin's this shit happens
Get orders from my nigga Charlemagne the ship Captain
You sound like a bitch yappin' 
This shit is all Natural to us
Like blowin' endo out the window in the back of the bus
I move back and I bust
Rapid fire
You actin' flyer
Now your family's in black attire
With mad desire
When we caught you in the line of duty
You had it in your mind to shoot me
But every soldier of my kind sollutes me
Now I'm reclinin' with a Lucy
All of my niggas
Smoke it down to the filter
Holdin' a frown with a picture
You smell the smoke when I walk past
You saw blasts
You should've known about the drama in my warpath.

[Chorus]
Mayday Mayday, raise the white flags, time for the payday,
Payday, and it's like that, out shit is World Wide, North, South, East,
And West, put on your shield, lets see who's the best. Repeat 1x

[Verse 2: Mr. Voo-Doo]

You feel the burnin' emission
You squirm in submission
No terms and conditions
Ya'll confirm my suspicions
That ya'll are bitches that resemble Men
Like female Tennis players at Wimbledon
Why you tremblin'?
Shook like the ricter
My voice raise waves
And make ya'll change ways like crooks turnin Muslim
Blast shots burnin' your Bosom
Like bitch cramps
You got lucky your people told you switch camps
Or get damp with plenty led
I'm like a beast with many heads
Sort of like the Predators dreads
I got more arms than Dr. Octavious
Rock your whole block radius
I be the bomb
And I bleed nitrogliceren if you slice my palm
The Don been gone for how long from the rap biz?
Wet more domes than John the baptist
When the gat spits
It ain't over 'till the last man's limbs
Are twisted like he was doin Yoga
In fact my Pistol's longer than the Jokers
I ignite Mag's
Leave your toe wearin' a white tag
So, ya'll niggas better raise the white flag.

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: L-Swift]

I swear theres a war in the air in the New York streets
You talk beef?
You had a swollen Melon, now you humble
With loaded weapons, nowhere to run to
We mega high, jet in the sky, droppin' bombs, 
Prepare to crumble as we rock on, 
Beware of the jungle with Anaconda's
Don't puff too much 'cause the enemy smells the Marijuana
We blastin' every object in Combat with honor
So yo, remember the agenda with the plan of action
No retreat, no surrender, keep the cannons blastin'
We blastin' heat 'till each member turns into has-beens
Soldiers bangin', who's click'll get done?
My crew can taste victory at the tip of the tongue
Always prepared physically, take the clip for the gun
And put it in, 'cause when it's on how many niggas'll run?
You said we couldn't win, bullets in ya flesh, cave in your chest
You pullin' for breath, I'm claimin' your death
You shouldn't've stepped, war paint on my chest
Fatigue green and black
And the heat reacts
To make you bleed like hemophiliacs
See me strapped, heavily armed, repetitively
Releasin' caps 'till the enemy's gone, definitely
My people pack metal for me, let a legend be born
I declare war, (What mothafucka!) and it's on.

That whisper kiss. Hey, hey ,hey. Pull the shades. I'm gutted. Guilty, played. And lonely.
I admit you wont see me again. My end is desperately engaged. Dark, departed, hollow.
You see I'm just a shadow. This ravenous beast is chasing shame. A shadow he remains.
How will my voice carry tonight? How do i look under these lights? Shove my head into the grand ivory keys.
Maybe this will teach me how to sing. Fuck hope, I'm a terror. Heavyweight human disaster.
I think I found Love. but what's love? When we cant be loved? Burn, burn, burn it down.
Icarus just hit the ground. To the youth that thought they could fly. I bottled up just drank up and died.
Palest white. I'm blues and reds. This patriot is long past dead. Forever ending. Remain but still gone.
Oh god I fear the steel. Oh how I fear the steel. Burn. My end is desperately engaged."

I keep forgetting, I keep rebuilding.
This is when I say I'm done.
I haven't learned.
No one will show me, so I go on my own.
Honestly, I'm so fucking pitiful.
Don't tell me what I've heard before.
Destined to walk another day alone.
This day is dying.
This day is fucking dead.
Just shine my way back home.
You can stay if you find comfort.
Don't speak.
Just breathe instead.
Just don't leave me alone.
I don't just need it, I deserve it.
I want what I promised myself.
I want what you promised us all.
I'm coming to terms.
This is the end of denial.
Sometimes things just fall apart.
Angels laugh above me and demons wait below.
I'm naked, bare, and broken, ready to go home.
Now I need you more than ever.
And when heaven overlooks me I'll need you there to pick me back up"

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
There's always something in this everchanging life
And there probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by

With cotton candy in your one hand and your other hadn in mine
It seems just like yesterday, letter jackets and football games girl
We've come a long way through the years had our fair share of heartache and tears

Chorus
We've had our ups and downs and turn arounds but our love was stronger than any fight
Even when we lost control we never let go we kept on hangin' on for dear life
I know no matter the size of the mountain you and me will be side by side
Baby ain't life and love one big rollercoaster ride

Back in the day we were cool and crazy like two outlaws on the run
Now making love means making babies and I swear we're having twice the fun
It's been no walk in the park but then again that's not our style
It wouldn't be too entertaining without a little drama every once in awhile

With those butterfly first time feelings you've always kept me on the edge of my seat"

In darkness we do what we can
In daylight we're oblivion
Our hearts so raw and clear
Are turning away, turning away from here

On water we have walked like the fearless child
What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild
And in search for confirmation
We have jumped into the fire
And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire

Chorus

There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past
Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast
And there's those that try to tame it
And the carve it into stone
Ah but words cannot extinguish it
However hard they're thrown

Chorus

On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams
By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams
And in searching for acceptance
They have given it away
Only the children of our children
Know the price they had to pay

We're staring at all these lights

How can I begin to say

In Paris on winter nights
Beneath a snowy veil?

And who's pumping drugs into our community
Controlling the propaganda on my T.V.
And who's molding our children's ideologies
And taking away their opportunity
Were killing each other so we can live above our means
Cause what we earn cant even buy a fraction of our dreams

And went berserk?'

(Aesop Rock)
In slipped rhythm
Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta
Escaped briefly back to my apartment
I parked in front the fan
And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my
hand
'Tesants get the New York home game
With real life shoot-em-up action
Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art
Free game piece all included
I told this cat the earth was flat
He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself
for being stupid
Brick-a-brak novelty
Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey
Godspeed Tequila worm future, be concerned
My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings
While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings
I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection
I'm stubborn as a thousand born-agains avoiding questions
From the alpha to the zed
I bake the date up for my pledge
To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled
Not a creature stirred, it reeks of subway metal
Bevel-edge journalist chin on fish shenanigans
Recording mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room
Mummified mannequins with future cleanse adamant
And skeleton in cabinet
This amalgam circus, got a ring of fire
Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle
I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew
Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you (SUCKA!)
I lay the law down upon its belly
With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk
Yelling 'Break yo'self!'

I'm the actualized data commission
Past penny tip jar donation arrangement 
Rather far-fetched from stability 
Took a heart pledge early on
Bled onto the drum doser
Plow in the metronome, home 
Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster
Sensationally seismograph stabbin away on stone tablets
To sketch up out your future
I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand
But have canceled developed, courtesy America
Land of the free base
Home of the triplicate grill character
My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker
It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed
With dilapadated winter jacket
I rock a crooked lid piece
A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet
Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed
Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate
Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit
Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit
apparently
Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh
at me'
Ok, time to buckle the f**k down 
Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin
You can catch the memoir in several dimensions
The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process
Hence, your plight botches

'I don't know what got into me
I didn't mean to cause all that destruction
I'm sorry...so sorry'

This be the big

Take a look around and tell me what you see.
Cause here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked.

And it would be a shame if you leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be.

The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad.
And now you say that you've grown tired
And you want to be by yourself a while.

It would be a shame if you go
And find that freedom was a long time ago

I know you can't stand for chains to bind you
But they just keep on driving us apart.
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from you're heart.

So one more time for old times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest.
Please don't throw this moment away.
We can forget the bad and take the best.

And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake.
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for old times sake."

It's all around us and it's everywhere,
And it's deeper than Royal blue.
And it feels so real you can feel the feeling!

And that's The Majesty Of Rock!
The fantasy of Roll!
The ticking of the clock,
The wailing of the soul!
The prisoner in the dock,
The digger in the hole,
We're in this together...and ever...

In the shade of a jungle glade,
Or the rush of the crushing street,
On the plain, on the foamy main,
You can never escape from the beat.
It's in the mud and it's in your blood
And its conquest is complete.
And all that you can do is just surrender.

To the Majesty of Rock!
The Pageantry of Roll!
The crowing of the cock,
The running of the foal!
The shepherd with his flock,
The miner with his coal,
We're in this together...and ever...

When we die, do we haunt the sky?
Do we lurk in the murk of the seas?
What then? Are we born again?
Just to sit asking questions like these?
I know, for I told me so,
And I'm sure each of you quite agrees:
The more it stays the same, the less it changes!

And that's The Majesty Of Rock!
The Mystery of Roll!
The darning of the sock,
The scoring of the goal!
The farmer takes a wife
The barber takes a pole.

Taking off my shirt and breaking them sweats
Tattoos all over my body 7 on the stomach,
Skull on my chest, Nine millimetre in my pocket
Ready to buck on the crowd,
As long as that one little nigga
Sagging and bragging and talking loud
Talking about he bout it bout it
Nigga I got yo whole clik
Real niggas don't run they mouth
Real niggas make moves and get rich

Verse 4: Flesh N Bone

Mobbing in ah Expedition
Thinking of ah proposition
Settle my composition
Feeling relentless fucking up gun condition
Mo murda competition,
How many niggas on the frontline
Ready for whateva my nigga wid yo tech nine
Nigga disrespect mine,
How will you lose the chalk
For marrow rip through thine spine
If you wanna listen to what I say
Hey gotta pay intuition,
This ain't no free exploit of an exhibit
Cause, my niggas, to exquisite
I'm so armageddon, just as my Smith &amp; Wesson
Here's a nice slug for you
And my nitrogen glyc bomb
Can land on them newly morgue
I watch when they all come stormin'
So when my one hit 'em up they fall
Let off wid ah little frustration bust my gun
Bullets haul

Get caught, think not, light Brown 
Cause we're not to be stopped

I came up fast in this crap game they call a rap game 
What the damn she's killin it again from that dame 
Now every snake fake-faced O jig 
I'm like, just don't sell me the 'Bridge, I buy lakes 
Friends even bend rules, chicks I lent jewels 
Says, ""She's actin funny now, oh she's got money now"" 
Tryin to do my thing y'all, need you on my team 
But you aint gon' stop my dream, or block my cream 
I liked things better when you called me Ings 
A year before Rap City, way before Screen Scene 
'Fore they knew who Foxy was, you probably was 
The first to keep it real wit all my secrets concealed 
Things got ill the minute I got a deal 
And my time got shorter and you was havin a daughter 
Had to stop hopscotch, get off Iran 
Damn I wish we were still playin jump

If I could take this back I would 
If I could rewind the time to when it was all good 
I would, take it back to when we said good-bye 
If I... 

My so-called man thinkin he slick cause I stay on tour 
Thought he'd never get caught tryin to play on whores 
I cried as my keys was scrapin the car doors 
From the trunk, to the hood, by the wheel and the floor 
Exposed my vulnerable side, had me open wide 
Said you forever keep it real, but you lied 
Was the first to feel inside, the Ill Na Na 
Had me thirst when you whispered to me, ""How it feel mama?"" 
Yeah, but don't hurt it, I like the way you work it 
No Diggity, don't stop get busy 
Blew up your pager, checked your clothes 
Duked your house keys, stole your beeper code 
What happened to the Mo's and the occasional roses 
Massages and the bubble baths, rubbin my toes as 
I realize you was just misleadin me 
I shoulda known, you left your last chick to be with me 

Chorus 

Mommy dearest tried to prepare us for a lot ahead 
You never heard, preferred to smoke your lye instead 
On the one to one combo told me you'd die for bread 
That's why I spend these nights, cryin in the bed 
You had the deep dish six, your rep was widespread 
I tried to intervene you said it was over my head 
Said I'd never understand the plight of a black man 
Right, but I'm tryin to keep you in my life 
V.I.A. satellite, talkin them burn outs 
Soon you had me whylin and you turned me out 
Taught me bout how to win, the code of the streets 
Luxuries and wealth untold it was sweet 
And one night you asleep after work was chopped up 
Felt somethin strange in my veins, I popped up 
One foot in the house shoot flew to the horn 
Got the cell operator, I knew you was gone

Hide your face, my love
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows
Hide your coloured cotton gloves
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures
Hide your neatly scissored locks
Hide your memories, hide them all
Stuff them in a cardboard box
Or throw them into the street below
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow
For you might think I'm crazy
But I'm still in love with you

Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all

Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair
The other one resting on your hip
Without a solitary care
I fall to sleep in the summer rain
With no single memory of pain

Would've left me long ago 
If he wasn't tied to my feet 
He's always been a scared one 
Turn off the lights and he runs 
Nowhere to be seen 

I am lonely only when I'm alone 

I need more than a shadow 
Someone that won't go 
Whenever life grows dark 
You're the only one I know 
Whose love never lets go 
We'll never be apart 
Never be apart 

You and me, we've got a good thing 
We move so smoothly 
You lead and I will follow 
You're closer than a brother 
I'm a book, You're the cover 
You surround my soul 

With You only my lonely is gone 

You're so much more than a shadow 
Someone that won't go 
Whenever life grows dark 
You're the only one I know 
Whose love never lets go 
We'll never be apart 

Never be apart 
You eclipse my heart"

no questions
I pledge resistance to the grass
that hides the snakes of America
so they watch it, now I walk with caution
more careful put more thought to options
Is the opposite of progress Congress?
From the school to the street we're beyond stress
but I fight for peace, that's what the problem is
war is big biz, ask an economist
speak in volumes callin' anti-war and anti-American synonymous
Back in the day I would've gotten black listed just for speakin' up
Hoover probably would've screamed Communist!
I want black and brown unity
but cats get out to bring the jail to the community
Fightin's nothin' new to me
I even corrected what the public school system tried to do to me
Here's a spark encoded in rhyme and love for everyone of the devoted in line...
We call it art, some call it a crime
it's the rap Michael Moore, like Bowling for Columbine
on drums, Fahrenheit, 9-1-1
Al Queda hit the Apple and the world was stunned
the villain trained by the hero for the killing
now you twist $20 bills to see buildings
Under heavy surveillance
they might call you a traitor if you want something greater
Don't get me wrong, America's a great place to live
just listen to the knowledge I give
if more than half the budget goes to military spending
less than half goes to whatever it's defending
One nation, many gods, individuals with liberties
and justice for all who are miserable

Hear my voice and drink my tears
I await you with firetunes
Veiled in everlasting silence

As we danced as one with the dryads of July

Autumnal storms of endless grey
The harvester will sorrow reap
You saw the spring, the spring in May

Gettin' just as close to any body as I could
I don't regret a single bed I've laid my body down on
Ever since the first I had

I can't mend

Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

I get smothered in dispair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming,
Begging pleading no more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul

This disorder in creation of life
Within this endless reign
Vision of lost words rise

Black god to raise hate in veins of the apocalypse
Holocaust of this testament in perceived idea of doom

The left hand of darkness shall bring this final redemption
Conspiracy in the offerings shall ring in horns of requiem

The principle power of deception in tainting the idol's blood
Held in this testimony for the opening of revelation
Unleash the revenge
Bound in the inverted rites

Raise the great wargate in promise of the fallen ones
Adorned in rank through dark incantations, marching forth
Disfigure in abstract reason
Embrace the blind god
Suspension of this balance will break and fall

Be the sword of evil in dissecting of this praise of mercy
Monumental torture within the halls of the cleansed
Perverse in this exploration of a medium absorbed in fear
This lifeless blasphemy will assume the form of wrath

Desecration
An arousing repulsion to this spirited resistance
This desolate becoming

Supremacy
In attaining this oblivion
This force of hell
Great heavens will burn

Bastard in praise with tainted thought
Creation in death
Bound in nails
Great crown of razors
This truth bathed in lies

Fascination of the compelling terror that lies within dark hearts
Warning of the coming horsemen
These revelations will bring sacrifice

Descending
Chained under the earth
The judgment of rebirth
Arise from flame and blood

Revolt of descent
Rebellion in swarms
Dying forgiveness for unanswered prayers."

Squeaky clean kids by his side.

Pent up frustrations runnin' inside me now,

I'm a victim of circumstance, a victim of circumstance.

What you doin' for the workers ?
What you doin' for the unemployed ?
Keep dishin' out money for all those jerkers,
Can'y say I'm over-joyed.
So don't mess with my life,
I've had to scrape and fight.
Just give me some hope it's gonna get better, 
Maybe I can sleep at night.

A little photograph,
Of his army wedding
Those medals on his uniform,

What would it take to pay the rent in for that sunny day

I can't tell you what to do
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too

How everybody's got a dream but they feel they won't win
'Cause somebody who was willin', who wanted to be chillin'
So they could never make it even if they were willin'

So everybody in my generation oughta know
No matter what we take from this scene

Où la savane se fane à l'ombre

Dans ce minable safari domestique
Où même le roi de la jungle abdique
Loin de la savane et des vastes plaines

Crinière en calvitie, derrière son grillage
Il ne tourne même plus comme un lion en cage
A quoi bon encore jouer les bêtes féroces
Quand on ne fait même plus peur aux gosses
Sous la volière des rapaces résignés
Regardent en l'air sans plus rien espérer
A côté les simagrées des singes sans gène
Et un petit train que les enfants dédaignent
Un couple d'éléphants piétine d'ennui
Aux défenses d'ivoire inutiles et ternies
Pour essayer d'atténuer la déprime qui les gagne
Faudrait un Lexomil gros comme un pain de campagne
Est-ce que chez eux, les enfants d'Afrique
Vont visiter des parcs zoologiques
Pour voir enfermées des bêtes qui viennent de loin

Arche de Noé de banlieue parisienne
Curieuse ménagerie triste et funèbre

En un mágico delirio
Oh, oh, oh

Un seductor perfectamente fracasado
Al demostrarme idiotamente enamorado
Es imposible engañar esa mirada
Que después de unos minutos
Me secuestra madrugadas

Al tenerte entre mis brazos
Muere la imaginación
Se hace real la fantasía
Y se impone la pasión"
913	TRADACR12903CD10C1.h5	Colin James	Sending A Message	"You're alone
You're inside
And the North Star is hanging above your home
It's so dark
And there is no sound
Except your heart beating away like a Morse code

Out it goes across the lake
The prairie grass lies down in waves
A thousand miles are gone when it comes through

You know that
I'm sending a message to you

Catching light as it goes by
Like comet trails streaking across the sky
And ride it down to anywhere you are

If I'm not right there next to you
And a word can't travel across the room
That anytime you're gone you're gone too far

I, I'm sending a message out to you
I, I'm sending a message out to you

When you heat up the sound
Hold up your hands
The wave comes in at the edge of the land

Sending a message out to you
Sending a message, a message out to you

You smile
Because you feel it
Everything's starting to glow and you start to heal it

I, I'm sending a message out to you
I, I'm sending a message out to you"

Niemand, niemand wird dann fragen, wer in diesem Wagen fuhr.
Alle Worte, die wir sagen, rauschen dann wie Bäume nur.

Und das Lied, das uns erklungen, auf der Mundharmonika
Wird dereinst vom Wind gesungen und heißt nur noch Lalala.

Alte Wege, die wir wandern, werden neue Wege sein.
Unser Denkmal ist den anderen ein Kilometerstein.
Deutschland, Frankreich, Friesland, Flandern, singend ziehen sie dort ein.

Und das Lied, das uns erklungen, auf der Mundharmonika
Wird dereinst vom Wind gesungen und heißt nur noch Lalala.
Lalala.

Singt einmal ein anderer Sänger den Verliebten leis ins Ohr.
Sitzen die wohl auch nicht länger als wir saßen längst zuvor.
Doch dann kümmert´s uns nicht länger, wer an wen sein Herz verlor.

Und das Lied, das uns erklungen, auf der Mundharmonika
Wird dereinst vom Wind gesungen und heißt nur noch Lalala.

I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now

I searched for joy but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pain
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate

Something's missing
And I don't know what it is

It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
You never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is

I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test
For loneliness like this

En el ardor de una noche romántica
Mis aullidos son el llamado 
Yo quiero un lobo domesticado

Por fin he encontrado un remedio infalible que borre del todo la culpa 
No pienso quedarme a tu lado mirando la tele y oyendo disculpas
La vida me ha dado un hambre voraz y tú apenas me das caramelos 
Me voy con mis piernas y mi juventud por ahí aunque te maten los celos

Una loba en el armario
Tiene ganas de salir

Deja que se coma el barrio 
Antes de irte a dormir 

Tengo tacones de aguja magnética
Para dejar la manada frenética
La luna llena como una fruta
No da consejos ni los escucha

Llevo conmigo un radar especial para localizar solteros 
Si acaso me meto en aprietos también llevo el número de los bomberos
Ni tipos muy lindos ni divos ni niños ricos yo sé lo que quiero
Pasarla muy bien y portarme muy mal en los brazos de algún caballero

Deja que se coma el barrio

Cuando son casi la una la loba en celo saluda a la luna
Duda si andar por la calle o entrar en un bar a probar fortuna
Ya está sentada en su mesa y pone la mira en su próxima presa
Pobre del desprevenido que no se esperaba una de esas

[Quik] In Compton we call that spur of the moment
[Luda] Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?

Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't trippin on child suppo't

[DJ Quik]
Well my baby momma is, because she see havin kids
as a tool for gettin chips, that's with or without the dip
She told my lawyer she's a nurse but she can't spell school
Quite frankly she's a motherfuckin fool, idiot
Welcome to the city where you might see thangs
Like real threats, fake breasts, negativity hangs
over the city like a puppet string, pullin you up
You think they love you 'til the director yells cut
Now they packin you with ice and zippin you up

[Chorus]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
[KJ] And for once, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright
G'd up, my mind is freed up

Now on Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that's out to steal your bag and your jewels
But we check your medication just to see if you cool
You can't be dyin on us, after you live off of hemp
We party hard, like Ludacris Kim and Shock and them
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hen be
And hemp be the beats we flip thee and we pimps thee simply

[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin 'round grinnin, runnin 'round sinnin
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein alive, riiiiight

[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite kipper
Can't nothin go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill

[DJ Quik]
Now if it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Or you'll be wonderin where yo' house went
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show 'em in the back of my truck, at the FreakNic

Just for people who keep it all wrapped up inside.
Who needs formality in sexuality.

Ce s'rait dommage. (2x)
Mais si j'dis ça, je casse mon image.
Ce s'rait dommage d'être au chômage à mon âge.

J'veux des gros seins, des gros culs.
J'veux du cuir,

Arrachez, scouts, vos pull-overs.
Am'nez le shout, l'éther,
Les lames de rasoir, les tubes de colle,
Nus sous l'manteau à la sortie des écoles.

Arrêtez, Constance, vos lacs,
Plaisirs des souffrances délicates.

There's a time, there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps

Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away, gonna make it my home

Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind

Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can't taste the salt when I lick his tail

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me doctor, don't keep it

I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me, I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend?
There is some love that you can't fight

Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Running through the woods, laughing at the blues

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me doctor, don't keep it

Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift, good Lord, I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness

Naked in the river, skinny dipping my way
In the waterfall, I just wanna play

Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me doctor, don't keep it

Yes I know, Yes I know

Whatever you need just tell me
And I'll do all I can to please you
Yes I don't mind where you lead me
'Cause anywhere you go girl is everywhere I want to be
Oh I never felt so high
It feels real for the very first time

'Cause there ain't no woman likke the one I got
Yes I know, Yes I know
I said there ain't no woman like the one I got
Yes I know, I know

There was a time when my heart was dragging on the floor
And I thank God for the day that I saw your face and you
smiled at me
And you took my hand and you stole my heart away

I lost all my friends
'Cause I ain't got time left for them

Because there ain't no woman likke the one I got
Yes I know, Yes I know
Because there ain't no feeling likke the one I got

Cold and rigid guardians dressed of no life

We run and run in circles
Till the world stops spinning round
(Run in circles, and the world as we know it, spins in silence)

Till remaining breathless, panting
Overwhelmed by laughter

Starry skies of stains
Ultimately sorry
Uneducated random strokes of pain

It's a chain going backwards through the veins
Must sew up this wound and run away

I can feel their strenght
Through crooked-lightning desert pathways

Run and run and run the pathways
branching off through time
Two lone-wolves shared
the utmost silence of the time
(run, run the pathways as you share
the uttermost of silence)

Allí viví la alegría... distancia

Primer amor de mi vida... distancia,

I stood up and started moving with a childlike fascination
For those doors that don't have locks and the stairways that were blocked
So I dug through the obstruction, put my fist around the railing

And each step was far apart and far away from steps before it
And the air was getting thinner 'til I couldn't breathe at all
And if I happened to look behind me there were miles and miles of stairs
Enough so I couldn't see the doorway but I knew that it was there

And on the last step I was dizzy 'cause there were stairs in all directions
But I found another door and through the door there was the attic
Without old clothes, without a ceiling, everything had opened wide
Into the jaws of something bigger and suddenly I saw that I was

Upstairs and outside and
Freezing on the roof
Finally it had found me
The answer, the feeling and the truth

That I'm small
That I'm small
That I'm small
I'm smaller than the smallest fireball"

I'd gladly risk it all right now (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
It's a life-or-death situation, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)

How do you console my mom or give her light support?
Telling her her son's on life support and just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines

What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I, I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel 'cause look how death missed his ass

Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past

Probably around the same time you use to pee in the bed
I'd stay awake cause my nightmares was seein' him dead
The smell of burnt tires peelin after leavin him lead
The killer fled with a fuckin laugh
My heart pumpin on blast
I just stare at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin, fingers shakin, spittin up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
Their I stood stiffer than wood it's the homie that use to buy me candy
Now he's gone who's gonna provide his family
My air bring this shit up n' runnin I never thought I'd be that sick
Damn I wasn't suppose to see that shit
That's when I thought, it was more than 3 shots
It could have been the aimin for me, maybe he circled around the block
I turned around and my pops, he like 'what happened?'
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin', I can still hear him laughin'

And all of a sudden heads turnin', somebody did sumthin
This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it he lived around the block
Regular getting' money nigga but loved to clown a lot
Walk across the park stuntin' and frontin'
Diamonds in his ears, diamond watch on, eatin a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty and grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away
So he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected , shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy told him she'd be back in a second
But he ain't payin no mind called her a bitch about 4 times
Stayed in the park, with no niggas with him and no nine
And then in no time an older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat
Left his face all crack
Told him to take all that
Hit him again popped his chain with a frown
And left the clown with a stain on the ground

If we, roll up quickly, stick me, some was tipsy

I'd be dead

1069	TRADNRG128F4295A0E.h5	Kris Kristofferson	Darby's Castle	"See the ruin on the hill
Where the smoke is hanging still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten.
There's a story of a home
Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten.
See, Saul Darby loved his wife
And he laboured all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.

Though the shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.
Then one night he heard a sound
As he laid his pencil down
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,
And the pale light of the moon, 
Through the windows of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

Oh it took three hundred days
For the timber to be raised
And the silhouette was seen for miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down --
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground."

Old men crying, deny their ruin
Watch them try
The cynic laughs at the optimist's closed eyes

Darkness falls, curtain calls, the cynic's beer soon overflows
Other watches, has a seat, and from the same cup, they drink
I'm doing time, how long I don't know

William had 26
Blew his brains out, now look at him
John had only one
Watch the mother mourn her only son

I'm doing time, how long I don't know
I'll kiss goodbye my brain and body
And go to sleep for generations
And go to sleep for generations

You're just gonna die anyway"

She says ""Days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!"

In the queue for the lifeboat

You got to put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

And all creeds and kinds and colors
Of us are blending
Till I suppose ten million years from now
We'll all be just alike

Same color, same size
Working together
And maybe we'll have all of the fascists out of the way by then
Maybe so

Held a secret meeting,
Bringing powers of the darkness
Upon those who opposed them.
The cheif of the circle,
Known as Malchius
drank the blood of a young baby
Offered unto him.

They danced ecstatically,
The orgied frantically.
The demon had arisen
From the circle on the floor.
The chanting was much louder
And more piercing than before.

They are seven.

Seven are they.
Out of the abyss they rise,
When day sinks into darkness.
Seven are they.

Coven in charing cross...

Soon, a certain family
Living in the village,
Would die one by one by
The curse of the cult.
The head of the family,
A witchhunter named Mead,
had burned their leadser at the stake;
Soon he'd regret his deed.

Pain from Devil's we evoke!
Thirst and suffer til he'd choked.
The magic did take over
And the soul did feel the roar.
Incantations were much louder
And more piercing than before.

Born in the bowels of the hills
Evil ones, sources of ills.
Setters of unseen snares,
Death to all pity, all prayers.
Male they are not.
Female they are not.
No wives have they known.
No children begot.
The fiends they are seven,
Disturbers of heaven.
They are seven.
They are seven.
Seven they are.

I don't eat no meat.
No dairy, no sweets.
Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily,  to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
and, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
cause you dont want to loose - vitamins and minerals 
and that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable , so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy .
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.

How long ago he once had flown

When I was young he did relate
I'd watch the birds as they'd escape
From the greedy ground we grovelled on
Into the clouds and then beyond...

What kind of bird am I?
How can I learn to fly?

And so each day I'd try, he said
To let go of my mind of led
And with my body floating free
Swim in the air as in the sea

This was my greatest, strongest wish
And so the air did not resist
One day above the ground I rose
And felt the air beneath my toes

What kind of boy am I?
How can I learn to fly?

I rose above the tallest trees
And summersalted in the breeze
I dove with lightning speed and then
I shot up to the clouds again

I jumped off buildings with delight
And laughed at those afraid of heights
What need has anyone for fear
When we are free and the sky is near?

Oh, what a boy was I?
When do we learn to die?

And when I saw I was alone
And no one close to me would come
I soon forgot the joy of sky
And gently back to earth came I

I've never flown again, said he
Because we're all alike, you see
Our sickness strengthens unity
And no one needs to question me

What kind of boy was I?
How could I learn to fly?"

You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it

Took a little time before the D-E-L could see through

Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees

Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that ya try to impress Uncle Fester

We walked through the ice floes
To an unenduring land
Our future, our hope
There was something in the air,
The Age of the Unknown
Far beyond the sea of trees
The vision laid close

There's a place where the sun shines brighter
There's a mountain that climbs to the stars...

Day and night we built a reign
With heavenly desire
Sweat and dreams made up the bricks
That raised up our walls

Paying tribute to the gods
And blood kept on flowing
And the lust for knowledge
Was the sense of it all

Fly, fly to the stars,
Reach them on high
Bring back the answers of the night
Roll with the clouds,
Sing with the birds,
'Cos one day we'll have to say goodbye!

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Many years of harmony
The message arrived soon
Three big stars lined up together
A chill in the air...

The high-priest was dressed in black
On top of the stairways
Longing for the sacrifice
Of those who would dare

Fly, fly to the stars
Then let it fall
Into the emptiness of night
Our time has come
Time to move on
'Cos one day we have to say goodbye...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow
In this neverending way

Come with me to Paradise
Let's return again,
Let's return again!

To be closer to the skies
Living on a dream,
Living on a dream...

Here we go, carrying no longer sorrow
Standing up in the wind
Walk along, marching on for tomorrow

He brushes the side of me,
Like i always dreamed,
He stops... to look at me,

I'm gonna ask him to dance

I see him once more,
It's not love at first sight,
It's more like lust encore,
He's floating my way,
And I'm hoping to catch his eye,
I'm not sure what to say,
Damn it, this time, he will be mine,

He's smiling at me,
And my pulse starts to race,

He's asking her the same,

Could be an organ donor

But never know because shit I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling I'd holla that it's irrel'
I don't get myself caught in the jello jella, 
And pudding pops that other opt to call falling in love but

Way up on the summer range.
Found a place to make my bed
As the evening shadows spread
Beyond the campfire light,
In the stillness of night,
Came the call of a coyote choir,
And the song
Of the wind in the wire.

As it strummed the rusted strings,
It sang of long-forgotten things.
Many moons and many suns
Of the real Americans.
When the arrow and the bow
Stalked the range
Of the buffalo,
And the call of the coyote choir
Knew no song
Of the wind in the wire.

As the ghostly balladeer
Hypnotized me, I could hear
Bugle calls, and battle cries.
Broken promises and lies.
The spirits of the plain
Still sing their sad refrain
In the call of the coyote choir
And the song
Of the wind in the wire."

E dá mais de três mil pau
No cheque especial

São tantas coisas pra lembrar
Tantos filhos pra criar
Dá-lhe shampoo anti-caspas
Dois comprimidos pra jantar

Não esqueça o perfume da mulher que tu tem
Nem procure desculpas pra dizer à sua filha que o Noel não vem
Papai Noel não vem
Deixe de lado o jogo de faca dos seus sonhos
E vá buscar seu cachorro no cabeleireiro

Não esqueça o dia de casamento
Não esqueça a data de vencimento
Não esqueça o presente de sua cunhada (ai ai)
E perca peso agora
Perca peso agora

Se hoje seu café amanhecer gelado
Se hoje sua mulher dormir do lado errado
Podia estar mau, mas está pior
E a tendência é se agravar
Não é melhor se engravatar?

Eis que faltou
Aquele motivo pra pirar
Mas não há porque se preocupar
A sua hora vai chegar
E você vai se encontrar

Bebe água, dorme, não troca a cueca
Acorda, defeca e Amém
Olha, gosta, compra
Perde, vende, troca ou aluga
Sua calvície nasce prematura
Como você se atura?
Bêbado se dorme, cueca não se troca
Decora e afeta sua mente
Ira, tira, tora a tara, atura

Não esqueça a mulher do perfume, tenta o quê?
Nem procure sua filha pra dizer que Noel, desculpa, não vem
Eu disse, ele não vem
Deixe seus sonhos de lado
Use as facas para o jogo
E vá morar com o cabeleireiro, seu cachorro

Não esqueça o vencimento da data
Não esqueça o casamento da chata
Não esqueça a cunhada do seu tormento (ai ai)

Half her pressure blown away
Flounder in the ocean

Drinking heavy water from a stone

I know we can read all the signs
But after all only time's gonna tell

Put my heart into your hands

And you want me to join the team. 
Well Im not used to these kinds of things, 
But this is what the evil brings.

You could bring the waters up above. 
I'll bring my favorite people and I'm bringing all my love.

You want to fight somebody come fight the superstar.

There's nothing you could ever do to keep me from stopping you

So far and so alone a million light years away.

Tout est neuf et tout est sauvage
Libre continent sans grillage
Ici nos rêves sont étroits
C'est pour ça que j'irai là-bas

Faut du cur et faut du courage
Mais tout est possible à mon âge
Si tu as la force et la foi
L'or est à portée de tes doigts
C'est pour ça que j'irai là-bas

N'y va pas
Y a des tempêtes et des naufrages
Le feu, les diables et les mirages
Je te sais si fragile parfois
Reste au creux de moi

On a tant d'amour à faire
Tant de bonheur à venir
Je te veux mari et père
Mais toi tu rêves de partir
Ici tout est joué d'avance
Et l'on y peut rien changer
Tout dépend de ta naissance
Et moi je ne suis pas bien né

Là-bas
Loin de nos vies, de nos villages
J'oublierai ta voix, ton visage
J'ai beau te serrer dans mes bras
Tu m'échappes déjà là-bas

J'aurai ma chance le jour et mes droits
N'y va pas
Et la fierté qu'ici je n'ai pas
Là-bas
Tout ce que tu mérites est à toi
N'y va pas
Ici les autres imposent leurs lois
Là-bas
Je te perdrai peut-être là-bas
N'y va pas
Mais je me perds si je reste là

I can try to be with you, but somehow I'll end up just losing a friend
I can only reach for you, relate to you, I'm losing my friend

My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi 
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line 
You made it clear you wasn't just another MySpace mistress
 
And I didn't take it personal 
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit send 
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing 
Honestly it only made me want you more 

Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go 
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you 
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips 
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips 

I was on this website late night lurking 
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent 
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game 
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name 

But the fact that you hittin' me back made me smile 
You must've saw somethin you liked when you was skimming through my profile 
You caught me at the most pivotal moment
So now I'm emailing my love with a dozen digital roses 

So click approve, so simple 
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move 
Just click approve, come on girl 
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose 

Just click approve, you're killin' me here 
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move 
Just click approve, come on girl 
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point 
So this is me at my most honest 
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis 

Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit 
On a scale of one to awesome I'm the shit 
Just get over it, it happened god damn it, I've been waitin too long 
Even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go 
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)

But it's hard for me to not hate when I'm on MySpace 
I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game 
All my money's on the latter, this is not a LOL matter 
Why would you pass up a chance this great? 

If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back and forth for 3 days 
Rephrase
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority, I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face 
But all I got is this Powerbook and iChat 

Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back 
I stay on my feet
Shit
And be persistent 'til my name is under who you would like to meet

So click approve, so simple 
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move 
Just click approve, come on girl 
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose 

Just click approve, you're killin' me here 
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move 
Just click approve, come on girl 
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose 

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name 
All I know is that I'm smitten with your pictures wishin' you would feel the same 
I admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments 
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense 

Lately I been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought 
But it's all wishful thinking 
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin' you out 
And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about, then say something 

I check my inbox ten times and ain't nothin'
You probably busy doing something sexy 
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in 
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me

Awake, angels of lunacy,
Arise, avatars of chaos,
Incinerate yourselves,
In the blaze of Babylon,
Hierophants of the Hurricane,
We invoke the Eidolon.

Unleash the storm...

We renounce the sin,
Of mortal fallacy,
Bestow upon us,
Our stellar legacy.

Peel the benighted shells,
From our radiant cores,
We obey the laws,
Of finitude no more.

Ascend...
In Akasha to Procreate.
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

Give birth to the vision,
Let enter the voice,
And dare not falter,
Lest the demons eat you.
Confide in your Nuit,
Never your senses.

Nine apparitions,
The nails of Yod,
Drip from the moon
As unhallowed blood,
Anubis' terror to feed you,
As the night condenses.

Ascend...
In Akasha to Procreate.
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend...
Open the Silver Gate...
Melt yourself beyond all control.

In poisoned aberration,
Tarnished minion abide,
Convocating execrations,
To drown and smother, to divide.

Recline, Rejoice,
Discard the body,
And savour this, your threnody,
Divine by lust alone,
And second skin,
As the eyes turn to stone,
Let the heave begin!

Azazel!
Shemhazai!
Rejoin your kin in faith and fate!

Heed not the warnings,
We invoke the manyfold
Ny-Ar-Rut-Hotep
For we know,
There is no peace at the gate,
There is no peace at the gate...

Ascend,
In Akasha to procreate,
Strip the flesh from your soul,
Extend, open the Silver Gate,
Melt yourself beyond all control,
In Akasha to procreate,
Disembodied, unfettered souls,
Open the Silver Gate,
We embrace the stars
With twin black holes"

Ah, ho-oo-oh-oo

Fearless people,
Careless needle.
Harsh words spoken,
And lives are broken.

Forceful ageing,
Help me I'm fading.
Heaven's waiting,
It's time to move on.

Crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
Life carries on... it goes on.

Just say die,
And that would be pessimistic.
In your mind,
We can walk across the water.
Please don't cry,
It's just a prayer for the dying.
I just don't know what's got into me.

Been crossin' that bridge,
With lessons I've learned.
...learned...

Playing with fire,
And not getting burned.
...burned burned...

I may not know what you're going through,
But time is the space,
Between me and you.

There is a light through that window
...light through that window...
Hold on say yes, while people say no

Life carries on
...on on on...
Ohh!
It goes on....oh-ee-oh, whoa-ee-oh ho oh...

I'm crossing that bridge,
With lessons I've learned....
I'm playing with fire,
And not getting burned....
I may not know what you're going through.
But time is the space,
Between me and you.
There is a light through that window.
Hold on say yes, while people say no

'Cause life carries on...oh-ee-oh, whoa-ee-oh ho on...
It goes on....oh-ee-on,
It goes on.
Whoah.
Whoah.
Life carries on.

When nothing else matters.

When nothing else matters.

I just don't know what's got into me.

It's just a prayer for the dying.
...dying dying dying dying...

For the dying."

And try and stick me in the ground
Well you can tie me to the bed
And try and beat me half to death
But you can never keep me down
Well you can stick me in a hole
And you can pray all day for rain
You can shoot me in the leg

And you can leave me there for days

I'll still follow you home
I'll still follow you home

You can make a couple calls
And tell your brothers I'm in town
Put a bounty on my head
And tell my parents that I'm dead
And hope to hell I'm never found
You can steal me the keys
To your daddy's Cadillac
You can tamper with the brakes
Call it a mistake
And pray I'm never coming back

And I'll stay alive
Just to follow you home
And I will survive

Tomorrow morning I'll be dead.
This town will burn before the sun
Will drown in the ocean.

1539	TRAFFPR128F421A35F.h5	Anti-Flag	Spaz's House Destruction Party	"I wanna tell you a little story about a party that went all right but went all wrong
I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was ""Spaz"", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
""I should have one last party at my place...""
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
""You're invited to my House Destruction Party!""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

LET'S GO!

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, ""I wanna speak to someone who lives here!"" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, ""Is this the condition the house has always been in?""
She answered, ""Uh... yeah, it is.""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

They lifted into the skies of blue
As they all watched in anticipation
The crowd must have longed for
Their own rendezvous

Ready to wave my worries goodbye
Give me my wings
I'm ready to ride away
Ready to leave my troubles behind
What's over my head will soon be under my feet
Give me my wings

Those who patiently wait are made new
Through the turbulent times
Somehow they survive it
They will walk and not faint, this it true
Through the currents of life
Even though it throws them from side to side

So, I'm waiting on You through the weather
We'll take a trip where the eagles dare
And we're gonna go through it together
'Cause I've got Your promise
You'll carry me there

Give me my wings

Ready to wave my worries goodbye
Give me my wings
I'm ready to ride away
Ready to leave my troubles behind
What's over my head will soon be under my feet
Give me my wings

I can sail through the trials of life
Lord, You're my captain
And you're always there to guide me
I've fixed my compass
And I've set my sights on the ride

Give me my wings
Give me my wings

Give me my wings, yeah
Ready to fly
Ready to wave my worries goodbye

no habrá recuerdo amargo 
en cada luego despertar. 
Y entre mi manos las caricias
duermen ya.

Si es que te vas 
no habrá un reproche que te impida realizar 
la voluntad omnipotente de encontrar
aquel destino que marcó tu corazón.

Por eso, si es que te vas
no te preocupes, no hay condena


si hay alguien más 
podrás decirlo aunque me duela. 
Si esa es la verdad,
solo te pido que no vuelvas nunca más.

Si es que te vas 
voy a abrazarte
con la angustia del que da
todo por nada y es más triste llorar
Ya ves, prefiero abrir mis brazos
verte andar.

Si es que te vas 
caen las lágrimas
rodándome en la piel.
El frío intenso de saber 
que pronto no estarás
para el amor de nuestro mundo
nunca más.

Cuz sorry ass women just don't get rich
You could keep her
I'd rather have a fifi bag because it's cheaper
You can't come up for NL

And why these dirty khaki niggas tripping?

And in the kitchen and up in there on the dancefloor
By the big screen t.v. where your pants go?

Compartir un café, una esperanza
Todo el mundo para dos
Es el frío, es el calor, es la tibieza
Es descubrir en una calle desierta
Que es lo mismo ir
Que estar de vuelta

Fuck the Bible, get on your knees and praise my rifle
Your life is done there aint another place to run
Eat your own gun

To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am

Just what I had gotten into

Love can only break you heart

Sometimes, you gotta let yourself go

Was it good for you? About last night
Was it way too soon? You didn't put up a fight
Was it good for you? I won't ask again
See about last night, I want to do it again

I know sometimes it's worth the wait
I'm not the type to hesitate
No more feelings all night long
I really couldn't care if I came on too strong
Experience just says it all
You gotta make a move just as soon as you fall
Oh, sometimes, you gotta let yourself go

Repeat 1 X4

Was it good for you? (was it good?)
Was it way to soon? (it never felt so right)

She sat silent at the table
Her boots were brown, well should she leave town
To play the role of lover expatriate
A nod to the waiter, always her flirty behavior
You know she always gets one on the house
She pulls out a letter
From a bag under her sweater
And before she reads she straightens her blouse

There's a passion in being alone
A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

And out of respect, well really must confess
I never lost your number
I never lost your address
And if we remain friends at best
Sometime later no, no not yet
We'll smile and remember it like this

She put back the letter
One tear falls like a feather
And disappears on the bar room floor
The gratuity included
You know the letter concluded
P.S. with all my love

There's a passion in being alone
A grace in a loveless time
There's no new cross, there's no new sign
Only the sun and the changing tide

The guy that invented the cigarette
I'd murder that son-of-a-gun in the first degree

Cause, it ain't cause I don't smoke myself
And I don't reckon into your health
I've smoked them all my life and I ain't dead yet

But nicotine slaves are all the same
At a pettin' party or a poker game
Everything's gotta stop while they smoke the cigarette

Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette
Puff, puff, puff and if you smoke yourself to death

Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate
That you hates to make him wait
You've gotta have another cigarette

Old Dame Fortune was doin' me right
The kings and the queens just kept on comin' around

I got a full and I bet 'em high
But my bluff didn't work on a certain guy
He just kept on raisin' and layin' that money down

He'd raise me, I'd raise him
I sweated blood, you gotta sink or swim
He finally called, didn't raise the bet

I said ""aces full pal, how 'bout you?""
He said ""I'll tell you in just a minute or two
Right now, I just gotta have myself a cigarette""

With the cutest little gal on East 50 States
One 'em high-bred, uptown, fancy little dames

She said she loved me and it seemed to me
That everything's were like it oughta be
So hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane

She was oh so far from a chunk of ice
Our smoochin' party was goin' real nice
So help me, Hannah I'm thinking I've been there yet

I give her a kiss, a little squeeze

But I just gotta have a filtered cigarette""

Never die, surround my crib

Keep a 9 millimeter in my jeep - peep!

Ain't going out cheap
Make the mad circle on cypress hill cuz it's so steep.

A matter of believing
I can't help wondering
Who those miracles are for

Ah, they say there's always someone
For everyone, it seems
But surely that means everyone but me
Still there's a part of me that's dying
To believe, believe that...

Somewhere
Just beyond the reach of my arms

I'll find my way into your heart

It's enough to give an average, sensitive person the blues.
Can't get it up
I don't know about commercial appeal
But what you put in your head
Just can't help affect how you feel
So lets keep it up
Prophets of doom try to capture you
They get around like the asian flu,
But they can't get me
Because I go for the up

I'm on the up side
I look for the up (that down just ain't my style)
I go for the up
I'm hooked on the up
I'm on the upswing (I got my sights set high)
I go for the up


What's the point of standing out in the rain,
What's the sense of looking down,
It just gives your shoulders a pain
Can't get it up
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy
If you look for the worst then that's just
What it turns out to be
So keep looking up
The fickle finger just may point your way
It touches someone different every day,
But it can't touch me
Because I go for the up

And everybody's yelling at me to get back in line,
And they say I'm crazy,
But still they have their sessions of deep depressions,
But it can't get me
Because I go for the up"

Our orbits are collapsing upon themselves
we're retreating into the vogue where we're sucking the blood from the necks of guitars. 
Beg for the scraps of prose that piled up behind the bar.
Though we try and try and try we get the melody wrong but we remember the words. We're the parasites but we are delicate in the way we bring each other down.
We were oh so close to the start when they finished us. 

Aim the mast at the ground, x2
And sail us to the belly of the whale.

Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ahh...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn..."

Sweetness is a virtue
And you lost your virtue long ago
You know I'd like to hurt you
But my conscience always tells me no
You could sell your body on the street
To anyone whom you might meet
Who'd love to try and get inside
And bust your innocence open wide

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Gotta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame (no)

Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour
'Cause this road ain't getting clearer
Your train of thought has cut me off again
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one
Better tame that boy for he's a man
Sweetheart don't make me laugh
You's getting too big for your pants
And I's think maybe you should
Cut out while you can

You can use you illusion
Let it take you where it may
We live and learn
And then sometimes it's best to walk away
Me I'm just here hanging on
It's my only place to stay at least
For now anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions
Just to throw them all away

I'm taking time for quiet consolation
In passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy
So why should you believe me
When I've always got so many things to say
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made
'Cause playful hearts
Can sometimes be enraged
You know I tried to wake you
I mean how long could it take you
To open up your eyes and turn the page

Kindness is a treasure
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown
So I'll say it for good measure
To all the ones like you I've known
Ya know I'd like to shave your head
And all my friends could paint it red
'Cause love to me's a two way street
An all I really want is peace

But my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Gotta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame (no)

Affection is a blessing
Can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing together
But the tremor tore my pad apart
Yeah I know it's hard to face
When all we've worked for's gone to waste
But you're such a stupid woman
And I'm such a stupid man
But love like time's got its own plans

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
My baby's gone off the track
My baby's got a locomotive
Got ta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
Take a closer look I'm not to blame

Yeah
If love is blind I guess
I'll buy myself a cane

Love's so strange (repeat)"

We can find strength unending in Him

Filled by perfumes of past destination
A distant chaos far beyond
From what our eyes can see
The superhuman side within
A mixed movement of a demolished world

Unlocked narration of key elements
Creates the wall of past and future passing
Let's all wounds be now against our bodies
Release fantasy before the eyes
Runs sudden to the depth of subconscious

Decentness sun of night releases my fate
Half wayside of life and emptiness
Upland in distant night of galaxies
Glass awake the symbol of passage
Reflection demands the quest of existence

Kept upon illusions of fancy gateway
The sound of silence pours my body
Underground pyramid of blood
Creations and destructions of century bone"

Caught between the Scylla and Charybdis
Hypnotized by you if I should linger
Staring at the ring around your finger
I have only come here seeking knowledge
Things they would not teach me of in college
I can see the destiny you sold
Turned into a shining band of gold

I'll be wrapped around your finger
I'll be wrapped around your finger

Mephistopheles is not your name
I know what you're up to just the same
I will listen hard to your tuition
You will see it come to its fruition

I'll be wrapped around your finger

Vanish in the air, you'll never find me
I will turn your face to alabaster
When you find your servant is your master

I laid with you until the end 
Watching the breathe crawl from your bones 
My alibi was lost that night

To love me once again
We were lovers, we were friends

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?

The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

Remember when, just to feel my touch
Was all you ever needed
Oh it used to be enough

Remember when love
Was a promise we would give our lives to keep
And no river ran as deep

But was I chasin' rainbows
Blinded by the sun
And did I take for granted
I'd be the only one?

I didn't know you were so lonely
Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?
With my head so far above
The clouds I didn't see
That it was raining on our love

I was taking all the love you had to give
But I was too lost in life to know
That without my love in return you could not live
Now she gives the love I did not show

Am I to blame for makin' you that way?
Did I neglect all that mattered?

I am here at the crossroad
where my life is heading man I don't know.
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause anything is better then I been through
What I would give to get a sign from up above
Letting me know that everything would be ok
I wish someone could pull me out of the mud
Will anyone out there say to me?

Im here, For you
Don't worry cause I got you
I got you baby
Don't trip
Don't stress

Over the edge

Verse # 2

Now everyday that goes by, 
I see things that would make another man cry
I'm sitting wondering why
I can't find that someone to fit in my life
I was searching 
but am I worth it?
And will they ever think Im good enough for them
Despite my suffering,
I felt the loving
The blessing came when I needed it the most
And that is the sign I received from above
letting me know that everything is going to be ok
And that she was that something that pulled me out of the mud
And also the one who said to me

Im here, For you
Don't worry cause I got you

Or some other woman will

Do you hide inside yourself
So that you don't bother him
Do you laugh and shrug it off
When resentment begins
You know he doesn't give back
As much as he could
Would you slit your throat to sate him
I don't think that you should
Go down on him again"

Hidden from the land at the edge
of the world.
Hidden from the people once so proud.

Meldoria, a people sick of greed.
Meldoria, punished for their deeds.

During the last generations
they've turned their gods their backs.
Now they live in darkness
as the sky has turned black.

Greed and megalomania
carried them away in blindness.
Throwing all ideologies and morals away
for egoism and carelessness.

Let you be guided by history,
learn from your mistake.
Don't forget the high one's majesty,
do not let your great ego awake.

As the holy powers withdrew their support
great plauge infested the land.
The earth shook and ruined the world,
seawaves threw up and drowned the land.

Only a few survived the disasters,
left to breed a new generation.
Stand strong against the greed,
do not give in for the evil powers
of evolution."

We're throwing stones in a glass room.

Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa oh

We keep the beat with your blistered feet 
We bullet the words at the mockingbirds singing 
Slept through the weekend and dreamed
We're just sinking with the melody off the cliffs of eternity 
Got postcards from my former self, saying How you been? 

We might have said goodbyes just a little soon

Robbing lips, and kissing banks under this moon 

Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning

When the pearls in our shells got up to dance 
You call me a bad tipper of the cradle 
We're just tired yawns for fawns on hunter's lawns 
We're the has-beens of husbands 
Sharpening the knives of young wives 
Take two years and call me when you're better 
Take teardrops of mine, find yourself wetter

They've got nothing to hide
But the rich recite in numbers
Their fear resounds in side

Children starve by the millions
The false of the lame
Of the foolish few who knew them
Then led them to the shame

The king he knights the players
They all know the score
But nobody told his mistress
She was pushing forty-four

I don't want to know
Where we're heading for
We don't have long to go
We'll hear footsteps in the dawn 
REFRAIN
'Cause it's just some sort of
Crazy ride we're on 


The queen she knows the exit
She's been there once or twice
Whe her saviour got ostricized
For selling free advice

And her knight in shining armour
Comes sliding through the door
Sporting suggestive glances
At all the dancers on the floor

Well I dreamt all those lonely people
I knew them by their names
But their faces lost their identity
In the fury of the flames

They talked in foreign riddles
Lik actors on a stage
But when the word came they were standing scared
Lost in a doomed age

Hold on to me while I
Hold on to my Father's hand

Time will bring you to
My Father's hands

And the crystal tears they fall and flower in a barren land

Vai lembrar que um dia existiu

Fez questão de negar

Fucking taking everything in sight
You are the blister that never heals

Lives run by the slut obsession
I guess that what I get
I didn't see it coming

Regrets
No fear lives alone
Revenge
Water from a stone
Endless
No cure to disown
In my finest hour
on this southbound quest for power
This fork in the road is reoccurring
Going into battle with no vision blurring

To overcome death and hell

Somebody sing?everybody breathe Him in
Somebody sing?everybody say amen

So you've have a bad day
How long has this been goin' on
You can't count 'em using all your fingers, all your toes
Well maybe that's too long

It's okay to feel bad
It's not a spiritual crime
You just don't want to live your whole life long in sorrow
The clock is tickin' ?it's time

Somebody sing?everybody breathe Him in
Somebody sing?everybody say amen

I might be the best at looking at the worst
But one of these days I will be free
Living in this blessing as one who was cursed
Well He's still chippin' away
And I'm still growin'
And He's still working on me

Somebody sing?everybody breathe Him in

2006	TRAGVAO128F4289B5D.h5	Mobb Deep	Up North Trip	"Verse One: Prodigy

It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookends, the way things is looking
It's Friday, you in for a long stay, gettin shackled on the bus
First thing come Monday, hoping in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowing, home is a place you're not going for a long while
Now you're up on the isle, in a position that you ain't got to, refusing
to smile
But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requesting Pee, see you fragile
It ain't hard to see, niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
cause the war populations are
If this was the street, my razor would be a mack demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screaming, what you in for kid
Busting nuts, taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
Wising up young blood, before you make things escalate, and I would hate
To set your crooked ass straight

Chorus 

Make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one false move
And it's a up north trip
Livin the high life, make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone
Niggas is trife, runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one
false move And it's a up north trip

Verse Two: Havoc

You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked, you talk too much shit
You should have kept your mouth shut, all that gossip
Motherfucker don't you know my glock kicks, hollow tips
To your body, mad toxic, I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but i grazed you
Pop goes the glock when there's beef on the block, chill for a while
Make them think the beef stop, then I creep like a thief in the night
It's only right, ain't no turnin back, it's on tonight, and if I get caught
Then my ass is up north, straight on the course for upstate New York
Stress, smokin back to back cigaretttes, it popped off, gon' point in
the mess hall
But to avoid that, from head to toe, dipped in all black, hit them niggas
Where they pump they cracks at, Havoc, with the murder masterplan
Keep my nine up to par, so my shit won't jam, God forbid if my shit do
Run behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you, slugs in your body
Mainly in your brain tissue, witness from the scene, get ghost, stash
the pistol
So simple then, watch my back, lay up and relax, roll a sack, ?K-A black?
Find a shorty intact

Chorus

Verse Three: Prodigy

I got the powder, combine wit the powder, and water, it oughtta
Drop in a half and hour, in the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil, then I pause
And ask God why, did he put me on the serve, just so I could die
I sit back and build on, all the things I did wrong, why I'm still breathing
And all my friends gone, I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle, but my
Heart pumps foul blood through my arteries, and I can't turn it back
It's a part of me, too late for cryin, I'm a grown man struggling
To reach the next level of life, without fumbling, down to folding
I got no shoulder to lean on but my own, all alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse, fuck the whole world kid
My money comes first, cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me, cause niggas will have you
locked up
The snitch, be a man, givin police the run down on your plans
We're never goin down like that, so I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
The legal business, forever mine, fuck payin taxes, the last kid that shitted

And gave police access, to my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out, a lesson that you can't
live without

Repeat Chorus once
*Livin the high life"

Don't let your heart be hardened - don't let your love grow cold 
May it always stay so childlike - may it never grow too old 
Don't let your heart be hardened - may you always know the cure 
Keep it broken before Jesus, keep it thankful, meek, and pure 

May it always feel compassion - may it beat as one with God's 
May it never be contrary - may it never be at odds 
May it always be forgiving - may it never know conceit 
May it always be encouraged - may it never know defeat 

May your heart be always open - never satisfied with right 
May your heat be filled with courage and strengthened with all might 

Let His love rain down upon you 
Breaking up your fallow ground 
Let it lossen all the binding 
Till only tenderness is found"

I don't know what to do anymore
I've shown him all of my love and more

And he blushed at my verbal logistics
And he shied but he came as he asked me my name
And I said I am love and how can you resist it?

How can you resist it, now that you kissed it?
How can you resist it, if you go, I know you're gonna miss it?

Poetry in motion but it don't pay no dues
And me, I'm always playing my rhythm and blues
Sitting on the road, Bourbon Street

I got country cousins they got a steely knife
But he doesn't want to settle down for the rest of his life
So I'll just keep it cutting

Hearts are filled with passion in everyone you meet
The Boulevard is waiting, it wants to get you high
Neon signs are waiting to sell you anything you want to buy
But I know your devices, it shouldn't seem so odd
You lied from the beginning, I see through your facade

(Chorus)
Angel of light, I see you glow in the night
But you only bring darkness to my soul
Angel of light, You're telling me wrong is right
I won't let you're evil take control

They follow in your footsteps not knowing that you fell
Bumper to bumper on the freeway to hell
You lead them into wrong and you make it look so right
You lead them into darkness and make them think you lead them into light
But I know where you're going, too bad you're not alone
If it wasn't for the real light I might have never known

Angel of light, I see you glow in the night
But you only bring darkness to my soul
Angel of light, You're telling me wrong is right
I won't let you're evil take control

You got the clergy working overtime to widen the narrow way
You've got politicians everywhere listening to what you say
You've got false apostles teaching lies perverting the only way
You've got principalities and powers waiting to obey
You've got philosophies and vain deceits lying to deceive
You've got hate, and greed, ungodly lusts in the deadly web you weave
Somehow you've got so many thinking you're not even there
One look is all it takes to get them blinded by your glare

Angel of light, I see you glow in the night
But you only bring darkness to my soul
Angel of light, You're telling me wrong is right
I won't let you're evil take control"

One dynamite ride.

A bump and a grind.

A hand reaches down and rights me when I m gonna slide.

Trouble closes in.

I walked to the fertile crescent and built
the sphinx
I designed a pyramid so tough that a star
that only glows every one hundred years falls
into the center giving divine perfect light
I am bad

I sat on the throne
drinking nectar with allah
I got hot and sent an ice age to europe
to cool my thirst
My oldest daughter is nefertiti
the tears from my birth pains
created the nile
I am a beautiful woman

I gazed on the forest and burned
out the sahara desert
with a packet of goat's meat
and a change of clothes
I crossed it in two hours
I am a gazelle so swift
so swift you can't catch me

For a birthday present when he was three
I gave my son hannibal an elephant
He gave me rome for mother's day
My strength flows ever on

My son noah built new/ark and
I stood proudly at the helm
as we sailed on a soft summer day
I turned myself into myself and was
jesus
men intone my loving name
All praises All praises
I am the one who would save

I sowed diamonds in my back yard
My bowels deliver uranium
the filings from my fingernails are
semi-precious jewels
On a trip north
I caught a cold and blew
My nose giving oil to the arab world
I am so hip even my errors are correct
I sailed west to reach east and had to round off
the earth as I went
The hair from my head thinned and gold was laid
across three continents

I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal
I cannot be comprehended except by my permission

like a bird in the sky..."

You didn't know who would have control

Where it took seconds to shape fortunes
Your pains it weighed down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know made you so frail

Empty eyes look through the barrel, sweating fingers on the gun
One push off the threshold to target sympathies
Just a broken statue and the world remains unchanged
So close and still no place where anything would end

Trapped between blooded walls
And the fight was there today
Fists breaking against the concrete
None to forgive no strength to run

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up you wish them to cry
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning to burn away

Suffocating in the grasp of this hate
Driven to fire your last round
Escape from the air and drown under the earth
Dead mirror by the wayside, nowhere to turn

An empty shell buried to the ground
Prepare yourself to forfait
Another saviour just another failure
Where bleak winds grind the surface

Fear and regret stain dim recollections
An act of rash solutions
Last one there, the broken statue
Built with hands that are bleeding

Empty eyes look through the shattered image
And their pain it weighs down hell
Spilling blood to cleanse the memories
That you know make you so frail

How could it be how would it end?
When you wake up they are holding your time
Fragments of this being fragments of its meaning"

La marca de tus labios
Vi sobre mi amor desgarrador
Un signo extraño.

Vi sobre mi piel una inicial
De un beso solitario
Vi sobre mi amor ese color

No he sabido nada, nada más de ti

Another year goes by

Is it me on how I see
The face of mediocrity
I try to smile you see
Your lightness darkens me
Filter all of your emotions
Fake you're never low
Or face the one you fear
You're living through another year

Another year to lie
Another year goes by
Another year to lie
Another year goes by"

I got everything a fella would need
I guess most folks would envy the life I lead

But you ain't got love
No, I ain't got love

I guess I'm ridin' high (keep on ridin')

Get a hold if you wanna go
I raise my head and you can hear them shout
Such a comfort to know you're great, without a doubt

But you ain't got love
No, I ain't got love
Sing your song now,
Ain't got love
Woah ain't got love,
Ain't got love

Keep on ridin'

You might not like my style
But we've been hanging around this town
Just a little too long a while 
You say you're gonna get your act together
Gonna take it out on the road
But if I dont get outta here pretty soon
My head's going to explode 

Sure I like country music
I like mandolins
But right now I need a telecaster
Through a vibro-lux turned up to ten 

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl 

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
I wanna trade in these ol country boots
For some fine italian shoes 

Forget the mousse and the hairspray sugar
We dont need none of that
Just a little dab'll do ya girl
Underneath a pork pie hat 

Until hell freezes over
Maybe you can wait that long
But I dont think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever
Record this song 

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl 

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl 

Maybe there's nothin' happenin' there
Maybe there's somethin' in the air
Before our upper lips get stiff
Maybe we need us a big ol whiff 

If we could just get off-a that beat little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get a decent meal
Down at the Rendez-vous 

'Cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone
You know sound as sweet as sin 

And after we get good and greasy
Baby we can come back home
Put the cowhorns back on the cadillac
And change the message on the cord-a-phone 

But... 

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl"
2166	TRAHJCI128F92FFB38.h5	Kool Moe Dee	Knowledge Is King	"I ain't goin'
I'm gone 
Up up up and away
And I'm on
A higher plane 
With a brain
With a flame 
Feel the fire
Desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom
And understanding
Possessed by gods
Transferred to man in
A script of a book
A scripture that looks 
Like a Biblical writing
Inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong
Subliminal
Message divesting all men from 
Criminal
Acts of the Devil
Revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
With no spiritual level
Read the Holy Koran
Or the Bible
Because it's liable
To be a revival
For the weak who seek power it'll bring
Infallible power 
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
Who wants some
come get it
A battle is a test of wits 
And I'm witted
Hard beats a torch
And I lit it
Stop the music
Alright hit it
Now that it feels good
I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge
And can't get enough
Knowledge is infinite
Suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss
And they're kin to it
Party and dance
And don't ever glance
At a book or look
For their mind to advance
Caught in a rut
Chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar
Or trying to get a nut
Evil feeds 
Off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind
And of course you have to be
Less than a man
More like a thing
No knowledge you're nothin'
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My rhymes make
A meak mind anorexic
You can't hang without slang
So eject it
I've selected
Rhymes for records
To affect the effect
Of the rhyme that left
Hangin' like a pound
That came down
But you're hangin' the brain
So your brain's hell-bound
Lost and found
By the serpent's sound
What you don't know
Can't hurt that's profound
Or absurd
A better word
An ingnorant fool
Is a real cool nerd
Pockets are fat
With an empty head
Got a little fame and a name
And you're brain dead
You count dollars
So ya think ya in
What good is knowing how to count
If you don't know when
And history today
And it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes
Cause the brain ain't acute ya
Need knowledge
To understand
The concept of sacrifice
But man don't understand
So we have to fight
War
Killing people we never 
Saw before
Most don't eden know
What they're killin' for
Following rulers
Instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya
But the knowledge can stop it
Souls can't be controlled
It's a spiritual thing
But you got the knowledge
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My knowledge comes
From a spiritual force
Stonger than any
Earthly source
Propaganda
Hype or slander
I won't believe the hype
I understand the
Media dictates
The mind and rotates
The way you think
And syncopates slow pace
Brains
Can't maintain
Acertain
Insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame
Traditions 
All praise fame
Positions
Want to be a star
Drive a big car 
Live bourgeios
Ane won't know who you are
Lost in the source
And praising the dollar
Whether your faith is
Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God 
Will teach one thing
The dollar is moot
Knowledge is king"
2167	TRAHJPC128F4268DC7.h5	Carlos Ponce	Decir Adios	"Siempre hay un último beso,
Una última caricia de amor,
Una última noche,
Donde estuvo la pasión,
Siempre un último verso,
Que salió del corazón,
Una última rosa,
Que se queda en el jarrón.

Siempre un último abrazo,
Una última canción,
Una última luna,
Que brilló para los dos,
Siempre un último encuentro,
De dos almas sin rencor,
Siempre un último tiempo,
Cuando todo fue mejor.

Una última entrega,
Sin medir cuanto se da,
Una voz que se quiebra,
Cuando el corazón se va.


Decir adiós,
Para entrar en una nueva soledad,
Decir adiós,
Cuando el tiempo ha terminado para amar,
Decir adiós,
Y saber que ya mañana no estarás.
Decir adiós,
Y partir de nuevo sin mirar atrás,
Decir adiós,
A ese tiempo que ya nunca volverá,
Decir adiós,
Y saber que en el camino del amor,
Todo llega a su final,
Todo llega a su final.

Siempre un dulce recuerdo,
Una última razón,
Para hacer un intento,
Por ganarle al desamor.

Decir adiós."

A sacrificial lamb in white
There will be blood tonight

There will be blood tonight
A virgin drowns in the sea of light
Come all you faithful while the moon's full
Just believe and thy work will be done here

Secret coven, reach for clear
The holy spirit gemini
The seven sisters two of nine
Now wait for the sign
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming
There will be blood tonight
Messiah come reveal your light
There will be blood tonight
Our sacred shadow rise to life
There will be blood tonight
A hanged man soul is our dark knight
From him which is witch's to come
Salvation for archangel's son
Washed our sins with his own blood
Drowning rats die in the flood
He who's faithful he who's bled
The first begotten of the dead
Eat her flesh and burn with fire
The keys to hell for your desire"

Die sich an meinem Blut betrank

Die Bäume wachsen in den Mai
Wer will schon einsam sein
Doch heute in dem mildem Licht
Bist du so nackt und heiß
Mund an Mund die lange Nacht
Der helle Mond zieht seinen Kreis
Auf dem Boden
Da liegt dein weißes Kleid

Komm schließ die Augen, glaube mir
Wir werden fliegen über's Meer
Ich bin nach deiner Liebe so krank
Die sich an meinem Blut betrank

Komm, komm, komm, komm, komm,
Komm schließ die Augen, glaube mir
Wir werden fliegen über's Meer
Ich bin nach deiner Liebe so krank
Die sich an meinem Blut betrank"
2198	TRAHMQV12903CB2DB7.h5	Don Francisco	Give Your Heart a Home	"I hear your hollow laughter
your sighs of secret pain
pretending and inventing
just to hide your shame
plastic smiles and faces
blinkin' back the tears
empty friends and places
all magnify your fears

If you're tired and weary
weak and heavy laden
I can understand how
it feels to be alone
I will take your burden
if you'll let Me love you
wrap My arms around you
give your heart a home

It hurts to watch you struggle
and try so hard to win
but trade your precious birth rite
for candy coated sin
wasting priceless moments
restless and confused
building up defenses
for fear that you'll be used

If you're tired and weary
weak and heavy laden
I can understand how
it feels to be alone
I will take your burden
if you'll let Me love you
wrap My arms around you
give your heart a home

Take My yolk upon you
and walk here by My side
let Me heal your heartaches
and dry the tears you've cried
never will I leave you
never turn away
keep you through the darkness
lead you through the day

If you're tired and weary
weak and heavy laden
I can understand how
it feels to be alone
I will take your burden
if you'll let Me love you
wrap My arms around you
give your heart a home
wrap My arms around you
give your heart a home

And it's about that time to clear things here!
One generation follows another...
But something in my head says:
Keep going! don't give up!

Cold sweat - running down my back!
I don't fear the chaos!
A reason to fight is not making a stronger man
Cause they don't understand!
I won't calm down! I won't calm down!
What am I supposed to do? 
It's hard to realize that the time is running out!
Pow! we're on the move! resist worldwide!
Cause it takes two...
Your money is full of blood and I know this for sure -
We're gonna take over!
Radical! terrorize! and I'm not gonna tell you lies!
Our chances are low - too many problems we got!
F**k the police! blow them out!

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture! (x4)
(move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) (x 3)

Move! I shout it out loud!
We're radical and we're proud of it...


Change the things - together we stand and load the gun and make 'em swing'!
Love is a wonderful thing - a secret - a game
And I sing the song of freedom to hate!
Try to think international!

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture!
Destroy!
Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy! destroy! (x3)
Destroy 200 years of culture! (x3)
(move! we gotta move! move! we gotta move!) (x2)
Destroy 2000 years

Your freedom to speak is a freedom to lie
Whatever it takes to change .. I'm up for it!
There's no place where noone gets hurt...
A place where I can be on my own!
You should feel guilty if you're just watching!
There's this pain and a constant sound in my head...
They always try and get you back to what they define as reality!
There's nothing to lose but watch your back!
It's cold out here... (don't wait too long!)

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy! destroy! (x6)

Destroy 2000 years of culture! destroy 2000 years of culture!"

I been waiting for this moment for some years 
I've been torn down enough to know 
Everyone goes through this door 
Just before their lives explode 
Come in here with a heavy load

Walking down the road watching the day begin 
Radio song is playing off in a distant wind 
But you can feel it its a gentle love 
Coming out soft from the windows above 
Just when you have had enough 
Here comes the world you've been dreaming of 

Oh my my the Mystic River 
She takes your heart 
And you will forgive her 
Lay me down beside the water 
I look across at the sons and daughters 

Sun comes up each day to chase away the moon 
Even the stars at night they fade away too soon 
You can't do much about the trouble life brings 
Cut all the lines so the phones don't ring 
But stay here once from spring to spring 
Watching the ice melt the mornings sing 

Oh my my the Mystic River 
She takes your heart 
And you will forgive her 
Lay me down beside the water 
I miss my sons I miss my daughter now 

There's a tree that grows out in the burning sands 
Never a drop of rain that nobody understands 
You can push me I don't mind 
Leave me out here and I'll be fine 
Cause everyone's gonna have their time 
Up or down honey you decide

The waves would lash about us

Sometimes it's hard
And we're both caught off guard
But there's nothing I would ever alter

The wind could howl round our ears
For the next thousand years
I'd still be your Rock of Gibraltar 

The best thing I done
Was to make you the one
Who I'd walk with down to the altar

You'd stand by me 
And together we'd be
That great, steady Rock of Gibraltar 

Under the big yellow moon
On our honeymoon
I took you on a trip to Malta

And all through the night
You held me so tight
Your great, steady Rock of Gibraltar 

Could the powers that be
Ever foresee
That things could so utterly alter?

All the plans that we laid
Could soon be betrayed
Betrayed like the Rock of Gibraltar"

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo, they love the way I pin a champ,
Under a tinted lamp hear my voice blast from a vintage amp.
I kill the reciters of lies,
Get burned by the fire from the light in my eyes.
It's Kamachi, possessed by the pharaoh ways,
Underground like where the dead bone marrow stays.
The spot where you breath is where the arrow lays,
A sideways death for a narrow grave.
My shit hit hard like an Arab raid.
We blow up, ain't no need for a barricade.
They looking for good luck, like a barrel of jade,
They looking, so stuffed when the barrel is sprayed.
Since the five perfect exertions, they waited afraid.
The devil caught from the tower on the table is slayed, pussy.

Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up.

[King Syze]
Aiyo, my vocal duel, payments hiatus save the local crews.
Only the chosen few can ride with the most explosive crew.
But not you, jealous ones they envy us,
Cause we spit venomous, until books remember us. 
Hell fire embedded in us, plus sins condemning us,
It's just what I write, ignite cop killers and predators.
I be like this, best believe I cant be ignored,
Spitting metaphoric, until the chosen child is aborted.
When my mind's in orbit, forces knock you out your high horses.
Deal with high sources, until the meal is five courses.
The flames is high, when my brain and the train collide.
Under much needed change in time, the game is mine.
Build strength through the niggas that be hating me peers,
But it's the army, part of me ya'll been waiting for years.
From a small block, hip hop, busting my tool.
King Syze, dope shit, what can I say man?  It's nothing new.

[Chorus x2]
Fall back, fold up, rappers are so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up.

[Planetary]
I'm a scientist in the lab, with a violent twist and a gift of gab,
Pharaoh tongue that can lash through your clique and stab.
From the days where you carried screw drivers,
in back pockets in case you had to prove that your crew lava.
We was painting on your property,
and until this day I still got rookie niggas out trying to copy me.
Planetary nigga, Q-D original,
Smooth criminal, bash your mental, bruise your physical.
There's something about the evilness of this track,
it makes the heaven's gates close, and the tabernacles crack.
In fact, it separates all the lies and the facts,
It makes you see the light right before the sky turns black.
It turns boys to men, it turns toy soldiers to generals,
Innocent mother fuckers graduate to criminals.
It makes you think twice about who you are,
It makes you feel like death's coming every 16 bars.


[Chorus x2]
Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up."

Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' 'em up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

A newspaper blown through the grass
Falls on the round toes
Of the high shoes of the old friends

Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends

Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be 70

Old friends, memory brushes the same years
Silently sharing the same fears"

He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly thru a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl till our feet grow small
Time will crawl till our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask went on
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl and the streets run red
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl and our feet grow small
Time will crawl and our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose

Yo my definition is a lyricist for hire
My vocal's a passport that never expire
Crowd loud like fifty rounds of gun fire
Screamin out ""The Roots"" while I balance wit the wire
Yo, expert in this profession, the session
In 1987, I linked up wit the ?uestion
Eleven years later we shared crop wit Geffen
In musical hell, but hip-hop forever heaven
My thoughts, interwoven and deep like Beethoven
This foul world so filled of shit it like a clogged up colon
Swollen wit minds that got stolen
Fake-ass cops, uncontrollable patrolmen
Torture, blood flow like bodies of water
Fathers sexually assaultin they own daughter
Out of sync, outta order like a puzzle
In the land of the unseen hand that hold juggle
In a Game of Life, yo it's hard to roll a double
Tryin times, take lives and separate couples
Kids thinkin they grown, tellin they moms ""Fuck you""
Under they breath, livin in the last times left
Peep the imagery ?strep?, across the sky like a canvas
And we're the artists beneath vigorous rough strokes of darkness
Time to set it off, let's spark this
Switzerland, LET'S SPARK THIS!!

You couldn't have a clue, it's about to transpire
The books I buy live arms ?I wire?
The Fifth, similar to ghetto gospel choir
We ex-plore the whole states plus record
In flight buds, trip that was a prisoner in war
Four-four the corridor, seal it, no floor
But I could see the drop was a mile aboard
To the bottom, electrical shock for rhymes
I said ""I don't got em"", guess it kinda presented a problem
When I understood, they said ""Let him go""
I woke, during a center to London ?
And now wit a past, fuckin wit border patrol
I'm findin it out, I'm leakin wit my people
Hit the studio, spread this information
In daze of frustration fogged the education
&gt;From Illa-Fifth to Switzerland destination
The Roots du journ, go check the translation
The dictionary of devout topics, far from ebonics
The Fifth Dynast, they can't stop it
Yo Zurlich y'all keep it tight heed
While The Roots Crew smoke weed
Yo, we are the ULTIMATE (rock-rockin it)

Trading our sorrow for sin.
We can throw all this away. 
For too long we have starred.
For too long we have fucking stayed so blind to every instinct as you paved the way.
So tomorrow we will take back every year you stole from us, and every night silently desperate and hopeless.
Every dream never realized, and every tear shed from these eyes. 
We will sin and you will suffer.
We will set fire to your machines. 
We will put life back into hearts and you will suffer. 
We will run life through our veins and you will suffer. 
Passion will be found in time, and your world will fall behind us.
Under your dark polluted skies, we may live as the damned. 
But our essence and soul and freedom will unfold.
And only in death shall we see the end.

Comes the halo 
Comes the flight

Torn upon winds of witchery 
Resplendent wings unfold 
Revelling in lucid lechery 
We invoke what no eye can behold 

Azure, her gaping portal 
I blaze in ecstasy 
The goddess calls, immortal 
Shrugs off all treachery

Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

You open your mouth again
I swear I'm gonna break it
You open your mouth again
My God I cannot take it

La gente arranca temprano,
Algunos mas otros menos
Es la ley de la vida, no se puede parar.

Todos fuimos puestos en la ruta del dolor,
Bicho que camina va a parar al asador.
Fuimos dos extraños así fue como empezó
Dimos tantas vueltas y al final no se quien sos.

Vamos a meternos en el mar,
La luna pega en el agua, hace calor en la playa
Vas surfeando las olas que el destino te da.

Y aunque hoy perdimos la señal
Así es la ley de la vida, es una ruleta rusa
Hecha de cal y de arena, de principio y final.
Cada día mas confusión, una escandalosa prisión
Una jungla sin compasión, hecha de misterio y traición.

Nos clavamos los puñales nena, por detrás,
Dejalo que sangre! Lo mejor es olvidar.
Sacate la careta baby, ya no actuemos más
Lo que cura enserio las heridas es amar y cantar.

Esta es la tierra del oro y el sol,
Sangre, camino, desierto y calor.
Entre tu karma y la ley del talión
Asi es la ley de la vida mi amor

Ya se que no soy Tiberio gemelo ni vos Calígula,
Pero no te paso a buscar nunca más con un Cadillac,
Ni los sueños nena, fuimos casi hermanos

So what, so what, so what's the scenario

Ayo, Bo knows this (what) and Bo knows that (what)
But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax and let yourself go
Don't front what you heard, but act like you know

Yes yes, y'all (yes y'all)
Who got the vibe, it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all)
Real live, y'all (live y'all)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that) Brown
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
(Contact) Can I get a hit (hit)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow how now wow how now, Brown cow
We're ill till the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario

(True blue) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of seashore
Ship-shape crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes, baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, and -eader, simply just a leader
Bass in the space means peace, see ya later
Later (later), later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflator
So yo, the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound (ooh)

It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked
Then they rebuked, then you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact (boom) from the cannon
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh, uh, all over the track, man
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Roar, roar, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (uh) the rhymes are on time (time)
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, motherafucka

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo

For a man just looking for the next cheap rhyme 
Visualizing paradise is a

But I know that I want you

What's gone and what's gonna be 
Time chases me, my mind races 
To find the place where I wanna be

As eerie constellations told before
This time you cannot hide
A maelstrom of inhuman fears
And the only way goes down... down... down...

Gone days of phantasmagoria
Welcome to the necromantic gallery
Where nightmares become so real
And souls are stigmatized with the sign of impurity

Desolation all around
Welcome to the promised land
Where no single beam of light ever touched the ground
Life eternal in a traumatic fade

Believe me this is not a dream
These dead eyes you are gazing at are yours
Call it heaven, call it hell..

Call it heaven, call it hell...
This is where the restless dwell!
Call it heaven, call it hell...

Even though you're singing and thinking
How well you've got it made

Who are you?
When will you be through?

Yeah, it's just a phase
It will be over soon
Yeah, it's just a phase

Call it women's intuition
But I think I'm on to something here
Temporaryism has been the black plague
And the Jesus of our age

I know that I sound opinionated
Maybe biased and quite possibly jaded
But sooner than later
They'll be throwing quarters at you on stage

Who are you?
When will you be through?

Yeah, it's just a phase
It will be over soon

To come true.

Had a twenty-eight Ford, he had payments on that

His woman threw him out in the ice and the snow

So he walked through the rain, and he walked through the mud
Till he came to a place called 'The Bucket of Blood'
Stagger Lee

He said, ""Mister Motherfucker, you know who I am?""
And the barkeep said, ""No, and I don't give a good god-damn!""

He said, ""Well bartender, it's-a plain to see

And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day

'Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head

Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
Known to make more money than any bitch in town

She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she's starting to flirt
Oh, Stagger Lee...

She saw the barkeep, said, ""Oh God, he can't be dead!""
Stag said, ""Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head""

Me and my boys went out, just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, ""Hi, I got a little place nearby, wanna go?""
I should have said, ""No, someone's waiting for me...""
But I called my girl up and said

""Listen baby, I'm sorry
Just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
Say again? You're dropping out

I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside, that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

Hey, I knew this nigga named Johnnie Walker
A nightstalker, a big shit-talker
Even though he liked a lot of vodka (say what?)
he was from Tennessee, sprung off Hennessey
Makin enemies fast - in L.A.N. they didn't play (what?)
He got into a Tanque/tangle with +Ray+, he had on too much gray
Ray had a Strawberry sister named Daquiri
Johnnie politely her ass behind the back three
Now, all four uncles E&amp;J wanna tossi
Martini and Rossi had to get the niggaz off me
He got jacked for his Dana's, in other words 
(give it up nigga, give it up!)
He caught the Nighttrain and blasted his Thunderbird
with the pistol, him and Cisco, couldn't stand him
cause he caught him lickin Brandy off his sister named Kandi
At this point he had more bad luck than a trash truck
He lost his girl, Remi spent his last buck up
Remi caught him shootin game at Elayne, so now
flowers and champagne don't mean a damn thang
Remi ended up runnin off with Martin
He was wanted for arson for startin fires in Carson
So Johnnie hired a gun named Rum, and paid him
151 and the job got done
with a thirty-eight straight to the face
He caught him in a six-pack and got they ass back
Up close he made 'em post and broke all their glasses
(?) and Rum threatened their families with matches
He felt he needed more men just like Gin
So he packed his strap and started claimin Silver Satin
From then on in, anybody caught bailin
down Seagram's 7 was bound to get sweated
Except Bartyles and James, cause they was cool
He knew 'em from school when they didn't bang and made moves
Turns out, he never reached the top
They found his ass at the beach ""on tha rox""

Un dibujo destruído
Y la caridad ajena

Un televisor inútil
Eléctrica compañía
La radio a todo volumen
Y una prisión que no es mía

Y una vida reposada
Ventanas muy agitadas
Y una cama tan inmóvil

Y un montón de diarios apilados
Y una flor cuidando mi pasado
Y un rumor de voces que me gritan
Y un millón de manos que me aplauden

2560	TRAIPST128F9302AE9.h5	Eminem	Beautiful	"Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like ""Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, ""Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (Oh)
Everybody has their private world, where they can be alone. (So)
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Spoken
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful. (So)"

Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas
Sleep all day, and grind all night
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks
And even though sometime, it might seem strange
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh
Now that's living like, who's the boss
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce
Even though she approached by them big time ballas
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with,
But she don't give a damn

If that's what you're gonna do""

You'll know him the minute that he's there
Oh can't you feel it coming in the air?

Oh no, not a summer song
Makes the night feel better
When the day goes wrong
My heart's just a singer when he walks by

Oh no, not a summer night
You forget about tomorrow

There goes my baby walking by

Doubting, unsettling and turning around, wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live? I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard, it all falls apart at first touch

Watching the reel as it comes to a close, brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all, it's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give? Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach

This is the crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lives, wondering what will come next"

She wears your ring, you treat her oh so fine
But you're telling me that I'm the one thats on your mind

You didn't hesistate to run to me
I don't wanna be caught in the middle of you
But your charm keeps gettin the best of me

Cause what you receive isn't always what you need

Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know

If you find a love you better hold on fast or you both get washed away

look outside the hotel window and my soul wanders off me
This is the time I'm mentioning and I won't soon forget that 
your proud beauty lingers on until the storm is lifted
Go find your fortune fast, its cold outside but you'll make it
Don't trade your love for ambition, or you'll get washed away

Chorus
Love cliché and you used to tell me some things better change all things won't last
Do the best you can, it'll all work out at the end of the storm you get to love another day

Where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peacable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek

American ghost dance...

A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide
And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved

American ghost dance..."

I'll be comin around the ghetto when I come kickin one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm pickin up and throwin 'em down like dishes 
Call me Kenny Anderson cuz I slam those Southern bitches
I ain't braggin, folks draggin me up and down the road
To be fucked up when I gets into my clownin mode
Then go to clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like I was Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggaz with machine guns, I think that is the answer 
But the question 'Should we take that bullshit from them people?'
I'm makin 300 on my SAT and I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of niggaz tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is tryin to turn me
Into a hate monger, and I'm wishin and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not, Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future 
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Strokin like hell without no paddle
But niggaz is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is

Chorus: Cee-Lo

I hear voices in my head and they keep callin me (repeat 4X)

[T-Mo]
As I step, the stage is empty
No words as I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Don't call me T, it's a T thang with a G swang
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' main
Smokin that dang dang, makin mics swang
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me
Cruisin down the block, just like I was a squirrel
In a world full of nuts, damn
I'd probably be mad even if I called him Uncle Sam
So bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie rather be
Don't flex on next, I break necks too
Rollin with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?

chorus:

[Big Boi]
Yeah, I'm steady buckin muthafuckas 
Not duckin 'em like the goose, I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggaz
Squeezin rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breakin
Speakin of breakin, break on how to get your life taken, boy
Fuckin around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringin the funk with the hollow tips
Playa shit is how I'm kickin it
Comin around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
So fuck it or flip it, I'll still be a playa
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
Shit, that's quickly how I run my shit and that's how it be
That nigga B-I-G B-O-I, that be me, ye
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinkin about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see that cash is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggaz around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, liftin weights, gettin swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string cuz these off in your ass with it hey
So you can see who can really hang
But y'all don't wanna do nothin, y'all can go to hell
Ain't no playas in office cuz I'm locked off in a cell
So can you feel me, nigga

Khujo, comin in dope, bring it
I got more problems than the average Joe
So don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
It's a jack, top of the burbs, and my notebook is a bird
K's madness into cappin
Throwin to do more load, so my fire lookin through the want ads
And only red hot, desire in your pot with somethin wicked
But you can't feel it, stickin out your monkey ass
I could let shit rot in the past, now it's time to blast they ass
Shhh...Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Can't even my wear my locs in
Demon eye scopin, oh my, peripheral vision got it 
Made you go on your hoe's bar
Decisions, decisions to make, oops, here comes the Goodie Mo crew
And they just might want to battle you
Out with the quickness
The price of livin is beginning to be a risky business
Unkay, Parkay. 
How do you like the taste of hot butter meltin through your biscuits?
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Don't cut niggaz I hang with before there were apartments
In Chapel Forest, it's gettin horrid

The waitress looked at me, she said, ""B., you sure look beat""

Early in the morning
It's early in the morning

I couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out

As . . .
We made a big dash
Really packed a killer

A change of time
Packed up and left
Goodbye the train track
You're lucky if I do
We'll go west
And get some big cash
We're lookin' back to see the way

Just keep a movin'
You keep away I say
You got to change your backdrop
You got to keep a base

Ten foot tall, lookin' up
From the bottom of a beer glass
It's too insane, in my blood
My hand is showin' like a road map
So I got on to catch a breeze
I hated to go back
But when I think of all those times
I just love the highlife

Just keep a rollin'
Just keep a movin' I say
You got to change your backdrop
You got to keep a base

I said, oh it's so clear
Oh it's so clear
Oh it's so clear
Said, I said

If you crawl to get on up
You're gonna level and get there
The feeling's gone
And you better get cleaned up
Start thinkin' of a new thing
'Cause now I see the other said
I done paid back, yes I did

Un peu rustique un peu brute

Sauf naturell'ment les flûtes
J'ai maint'nant des frênes
Des arbres de judée
Tous de bonne graine
De haute futaie
Mais toi tu manques à l'appel

J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux.

Je suis un pauvre type
J'aurai plus de joie
J'ai jeté ma pipe
Ma vieille pipe en bois
Qui avait fumé sans s'fâcher
Sans jamais m'brûler la lippe
L'tabac d'la vache enragée
Dans sa bonne vieille tête de pipe
J'ai des pipes d'écume
Ornées de fleurons
De ces pipes qu'on fume
En levant le front
Mais j'retrouv'rai plus ma foi
Dans mon cur ni sur ma lippe
Le goût d'ma vieille pipe en bois
Sacré nom d'une pipe.

D'avecque ma femme
J'ai foutu le camp
Parce que depuis tant d'années
C'était pas une sinécure
De lui voir tout l'temps le nez
Au milieu de la figure
Je bas la campagne
Pour dénicher la
Nouvelle compagne
Valant celle-là
Qui, bien sûr, laissait beaucoup
Trop de pierres dans les lentilles
Mais se pendait à mon cou
Quand j'perdais mes billes.

Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû m'éloigner d'mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre,
Je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux.

Pour tout logement
Avec des lézardes
Sur le firmament
Je l'savais par cur depuis
Et pour un baiser la course
J'emmenais mes belles de nuits
Faire un tour sur la grande ourse
J'habite plus d'mansarde
Il peut désormais
Tomber des hallebardes
Je m'en bats l'il mais,
Mais si quelqu'un monte aux cieux
Moins que moi j'y paie des prunes
Y'a cent sept ans, qui dit mieux,
Qu'j'ai pas vu la lune!

Cast upon my withered brow
The dancing of embers
Peace of eternal flight

The deepest of blue
In crimson night
Shadows my russet skin
In views beyond a winter gate

Vivid days of a child
Green are the trees of age
My love for the everlasting sky
Foreboding flames abode 

I will dream under a blacksun
No shelter to hide my skin
Tainted rain will taste so pure
Like black painted earth

Cast my disgrace on fall
Foretell my name in honor
Under a black dawning sun"

When the war is over we would be free
He said that we'd have to drive
Those Nazis back to Germany
His vote in the post-war years
Was a steadfast cast for FDR
'Cause he thought that the new deal
Would heal a nation's bleeding heart 
A man in his middle years
Shed tears about the economy
He said that the balance of the deficity
Would set us free
He was caught in a fragile state
Cause the Dow had never sunk this far
So he searched for the deliverance
At the bottom of a bottle at a local bar

CHANNEL
Everybody, Everybody wants to be free
But I'm here to tell you

CHORUS
Freedom
Can only be found in the blood of Jesus
Freedom
Can only be known in the love of God
Freedom
Comes to whoever would dare to believe Jesus is
Freedom

A child once spoke of the hour
When school would end and he could play
His freedom waited for him
At the ending of another day
His dream was to get to his home
For a stickball challenge on the avenue
If he could get past the dealer
Selling dope
In the middle of the hall at the grammar school

And you hold me
Like you'll never let me go
Like you'll never let me go

Sit down and talk a while""

I still see that look in your eyes

In a minute, sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June

It's so hard to think it ends sometime
And this could be the last
I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
To hold you
To hold you

But chilly, Mr. Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy, fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long
Until later

I should've stop to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on

It's over and you're gone

I miss you, I miss you so much

And wish ""if only""
How many times can I talk this way
And wish ""if only""
Keep on making the same mistake
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
I wish ""if only""

Devant son poste de télévision

Lever sans réveil, avec le soleil
Sans bruit, sans angoisse, la journée se passe
Repasser, poussière, y'a toujours à faire
Repas solitaire, en point de repère

La maison si nette, qu'elle en est suspecte
Comme tous ces endroits où l'on ne vit pas
Les êtres ont cédé, perdu la bagarre
Les choses ont gagné, c'est leur territoire

Les temps qui les casse, ne les change pas
Les vivants se fanent, mais les ombres pas
Tout va, tout fonctionne, sans but, sans pourquoi
D'hiver en automne, ni fièvre ni froid

Elle met du vieux pain sur son balcon
Pour attirer les moineaux, les pigeons
Elle vit sa vie par procuration
Devant son poste de télévision

Elle apprend dans la presse à scandale
La vie des autres qui s'étale
Mais finalement de moins pire en banal
Elle finira par trouver ça normal
Elle met du vieux pain sur son balcon
Pour attirer les moineaux, les pigeons

Des crèmes et des bains qui font la peau douce
Mais ça fait bien loin que personne ne la touche
Des mois, des années sans personne à aimer
Et jour après jour l'oubli de l'amour

Ses rêves et désirs si sages, si possibles
Sans cri, sans délire, sans inadmissible
Sur dix ou vingt pages de photos banales
Bilan sans mystère d'années sans lumière

Elle met du vieux pain sur son balcon
Pour attirer les moineaux, les pigeons
Elle vit sa vie par procuration

You're about to hear the free world's biggest lie

It's cultural suicide to make your faith a battle cry

Well mediocrity - is to miss eternity
You see He rose for me...

Don't take nothing less,
Don't you second guess
Nothing but the best - oh

That in your heart,
There's nothing but the best

Don't work at school, how can that be cool
Tell me who's the fool if it leads to a welfare line
I'm missing something here
It must be drugs and beer
'Cause it isn't clear why faith is such a waste of time

Got some news for them,
He's gonna come again
We'll see what happens then...

How can I get up, why should I get up
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever why get up

Phone keeps ringing right off the hook
Some bill collector, I know what cooks
Think I'll stay in bed, dream all day
World outside bugs me anyway
When I get things going, the going gets rough
So I ask myself why get up

Chorus

Went to the doctor, he said lose some weight
If you don't do it quick, we'll have to operate
I talked to my lawyer, he said case is closed
That woman got it all even the garden hose
Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck
Better roll back over why get up

Chorus

Well I can't quit drinking, I'm nervous all the time
When I wake up, it's like a ton lead on my mind
What was it, I said to that girl last night
She really got upset, I best stay out of sight
I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff
I better duck under the cover why get up"

Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air

It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton 
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is

When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats
They when they're gone take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is

Chorus

It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture

The storm raged hard and cruel upon the sea
They didn't know what hit them
As the waves rolled o'er the decks and snatched away
To fading memory

As summer gave it's life away to autumn
A promise made fulfilled on his return
A six month job with a privateer
Knowing it'll make him rich to give
All that she deserves

The farmers warned of nasty weather
The worst in many years
The winter took away her love and now
She's alone with her tears

The winter slowly passed away to spring
She spends her days out waiting on the pier
Spring turned into summer
And she realized he wasn't coming home
On a warm summer's day she went alone
Blinded by her grief she said goodbye to the sun
Up upon the widow's walk they saw her fall into the bay
A fading memory

The farmers warned of nasty weather
The worst in many years
The winter took away her love 
But now there's no more tears
She brought herself back to his arms
Within a watery grave
And now they spend eternity together
Lost within the waves"

We want to live as Your children
And move closer, closer, closer

Leur fête insupportable et puis leurs feux de joie
Nous partions têtes basses digérer notre nuit, 
Vomir notre dégoût

Et déja de partout bien rangés courraient les policiers
Leur petit chef debout au balcon de la honte

N'ont qu'à bien se tenir

J'ai serré fort mon fils, si triste de me voir si triste
Mais dans mes yeux je sais il a bien lu mon coeur

Ces milliers de bateaux
Je connais ce signal c'est celui de nos frères
Hissons haut le drapeau
Main dans la main nous allons revenir
L'heure n'est plus aux pleurs il faut organiser le venir
Et dans ces heures sombres repense à Charletty,
Repense à la lumière
A tous ces coeurs lancés ce murmure qui gronde,
Ne s'arrêtera plus
Dans ce nouveau maquis ne pas suivre à genoux
Ne jamais se soumettre et toujours résister droit debout,
Droit debout

Bien plus forts que jamais"

If I let you go

How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All has been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?

That I love you 

I don't have a plane that I can fly 
Spelling out your name up in the sky 
I only know 
That I love you 

So tell me you love me 
Tell me that you feel the same 
Simple and true 
And better the old fashioned way 

I can't take you on a rocket to the moon 
Write a poem set in France to make you swoon 
I only know yeah 
That I love you 
Yes, I do 

So tell me you love me 
Tell me that you feel the same 
Simple and true 
And better the old fashioned way

Nothing on this earth could sparkle brighter than you 
I love you"

Highways and hedges and Sunday school pledges
Back in the days when I could hear
The lions roaring in the lion's den

Back in the days when I first read
Jesus love me in the B-I-B-L-E
When Zacheus was a wee little man
And a wee little man was he
With my child like faith
And my clip-on tie
I would raise my hand
Raise my hand high

I want to read my Bible from cover to cover
Line by line, over and over
The more I read, the more I find, the more I uncover
Stories just like mine, I begin to discover
I want to read my Bible from cover to cover

There's still a fountain flowing deep
Deep in the heart of me it widens my memory
Makes me remember the pledge I made
To follow the Master from here to ever after

I've stood strong like Daniel
I've fallen like David
I've wandered in the desert like the Israelites
I've denied You like Peter
I've struggled like Paul
Run from You like Jonah
But You loved me through it all

I want to read my Bible from cover to cover
Line by line, over and over
The more I read, the more I find, the more I uncover
Stories just like mine, I begin to discover
And I want to read my Bible
I want to live my live

The lonely streets where we embraced
Then you are gone without a trace
Nothing's the same without you

Another day goes passing by
I sit alone and wonder why
Sometimes it's hard but I will try
To live my life without you

You're in my heart, and in my dreams
You're everywhere or so it seems
So many times I've heard that song
Hold back the tears and tell you're strong 

Another day goes slowly by
I sit alone and wonder why
I think of you and start to cry
Nothing's the same without you

Another time, another place
The sweetness of our last embrace
What would I give to see your face
Nothing's the same without you
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same without you"

A brand new emptiness inside
I wish that I could fill the space
It's not my place to take the place

She's been hurt and she's been lost before
This loss has her alone once more
Even though my girl's alone
She stays together strong as stone

She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform
I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen my girl forced to take
Pain, tragedy, and much heartache
The tears she hides, the smile she fakes
And through it all, she doesn't break

I don't know where she finds the strength
I'm only glad that she can
Just when I think my girl is down
She's on her feet again

She stops my rain, she calms my storm
Miracles she can perform
I've seen tough times, she's seen me through
And always knew just what to do

So many rely on her, I'm one of them and I know it
When demons haunt inside of her she fights hard not to show it

I've seen her world before my eyes
Get filled with evil, painful, spiteful lies
Still she fights, still she tries
And she will fight until she dies

Demons haunt inside of her
Demons haunt inside of her
Demons haunt inside of her
Still she fights and still she tries
Demons haunt inside of her
She will fight until she dies"

But one thing remains the same till the end of time
I think I'll remain, I think I'll just stay...

(chorus)
A b-boy standin in my b-boy stance

From the top of the highest summit, again we run it. 
A hundred and forty four shimmering lights stunnin 
Too quick for the human eye to catch a glimpse 
You know pimps cannot convince with bigger attempts of emcee'in, 
Blowing words in the wind, 
While we ascend to limitless ends and pretend 
We're still human, when if fact we're only half
the other path extends infinity do the max
I try to laugh, but they pull me down like crabs in a bucket 
With hands in my pocket, how long will it last?
Heaven only knows, so Kheaven keeps inventing the flows
That turns black prose to white foes
Your just supposin have you heard my words
moving at light speed and getting blurred.
It's all so incredible decibles at glance standing in a b-stance 

A B-boy standin in my B-boy stance

This one leads the way 
Now cut it up, cut it up back to back, on the wheels of steel, cut it up back to back 

Elevate, Meditate, eliminate
thoughts from my past keep knocking upon my gate 
Shouldn't let em in, the answers not to debate 
But to observe the debating and then we can all escape

Yo party people listen up at the drop of the dime, 
They took cameras to africa for pictures to rhyme 
Over oh.. yes, the great pretenders 
Religious entertainers who want to be life savers 
Damn.. another dollar for the mind, another cold ??? hoping 
They can't find, they can't copy or get pictures with no lines, 
I guess it's just a case of the blind leading the blind 
But, I'm flippin and steppin and rockin the roll,
Taking control, payin my tolls, losing control
I'm playin a role so people will remember that 
I'm just a servant of rap, hopin to bring it back 

Im a B-boy standin in my B-boy stance

This one leads the way break

I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
but I know you always did your best
in the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
and say this prayer for you tonight,
because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
when you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know: 
sometimes we're helpless and alone,
but you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be, 
it's being content with who we are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are

Stay who you are

Living can be a fight
Sometimes you find yourself wandering down
To the cold winter streets in your life

When you're a prisoner of the time
And the darkness is closing in
With all your heart you've got to rely
On the song that is hidden within
The song that cries out to begin

Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Let the song of your faith come alive

Like a cool wind that flows
From a valley unseen
Out of the depths of a trembling heart
You find yourself starting to sing

Listen to your own words
It's the power of what you believe
Let the chorus build louder and louder
And shatter the blackness and pain
Let it rise like a healing flame

Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Let the song of your faith come alive

Can't lock up the truth
Or chain our beliefs
Can't drown out the song
Of those who are free

Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Sing your freedom, freedom, freedom
Let the song of your faith come alive"

3002	TRAKDCQ128F42A247A.h5	Kool Moe Dee	I Go To Work	"I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic you got to like the way I operate
I make miracles happen just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent and I'm flowin' and explodin'

On the scene mean I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that is of which I chose
To make a rhyme and chill then you know

I will fulfill to make a couple of mill
As I build a guild for all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy if he's a sucker

Hang 'em to the left of me 'cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and the microphone that I own
And my game plan is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush it ain't no race

I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya

Runnin' around holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy yo man
You hear what he said another funky rhythm
Look at ya man and give him a high five

'Cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it I go to work, I go to work
I go to work like an architect

I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word

With each letter it becomes visably better
'Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone daddy's home

Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace

Start the race I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya I have to slap ya

Senseless with endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time

I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one

I go to work I go to work I go to work like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya

So hard it stops ya dead in your tracks
So power packed before you can react
You're flat on your back down for the count
Get up and dismount 'cause I'm coming
With an endless amount of words in a hurry like a flurry

A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote rhymes at a level so you can't relate unless you're intelligent

So stay awake sleepwalkers slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil

Rhymes in its highest form I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up a few casualties but so what
If you're slow you blow you know you go I flow
I throw all pro I go to work I go to work To say rap is not work

Is ludicrous whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me you'll compare me to a prophet for profit not merely
Putting words together for recreation each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation, I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work, I go to work, I go to work"

Threw it, never dreaming

It's work we understand
We don't want for much

Another day in the unknown
I can feel it deep in my bones

And that rock it missed your head
Though it didn't miss by much
I remember what you said
""No, I mean it, I am touched""
And somehow it is enough

So God keep our land
'Cause we certainly can't
Until the darkness ends
Until the sun tries again

Our dreams are where we're at
What we can smell and touch
Work we understand
We don't want too much

A day in the unknown
Where they been, where we're going
Country day

Another day in the unknown

Nunca perseguí la gloria, ni dejar en la memoria de los hombres mi canción; yo amo los mundos sutiles, ingrávidos why gentiles, como pompas de jabón. Me gusta verlos pintarse de sol why grana, volar bajo el cielo azul, temblar súbitamente why quebrarse... Nunca perseguí la gloria. Caminante, son tus huellas el camino why nada más; caminante, no hay camino, se hare camino al andar. Al andar se hare camino why al volver la vista atrás se ve la senda que nunca se ha de volver a pisar. Caminante no hay camino sino estelas en la mar... hare algún tiempo en ese lugar donde hoy los bosques se visten de espinos se oyó la voz de un poeta gritar: «Caminante no hay camino, se hare camino al andar...» golpe a golpe, verso a verso... Murió el poeta lejos del hogar. Le cubre el polvo de un país vecino. Al alejarse le vieron llorar. «Caminante no hay camino, se hare camino al andar...» golpe a golpe, verso a verso... Cuando el jilguero no puede cantar, cuando el poeta es un peregrino, cuando de nada nos sirve rezar. «Caminante no hay camino, se hare camino al andar...» golpe a golpe, verso a verso.

el amor es crear un mundo entre los dos
es perdonarme tu y comprenderte yo"

Traían 500 paquetes de esos que pesan un kilo
Los federales por tierra se las bajaron a tiros
Pensaban llevar la carga a la Ciudad de Tijuana.

Los estaban esperando ya estaba todo planeado
Para entregar el encargo a un narco del otro lado
Con esta ya van tres veces dijo Modesto Quintero
Que se pierden cargamentos eso es bastante dinero.

Si sigue la cosa así vamos a perder terreno
No va a ver de otra compita tenemos que negociar
Algunos miles de verdes a la ley le voy a dar
Y cuando crezcan las ventas lo voy a recuperar.

Hay que cuidar el negocio y mantenernos activos
Pagarle bien a los socios hacerlos nuestros amigos
Porque la ley es la ley mas vale estar bien unidos
Ya burlaron a la ley ya surtieron los pedidos.

Por esto Quintero vive en los Estados Unidos
Gastando mucho dinero que da el negocio prohibido"

Pride falls rattle we betrayed
Drowning in a flood of inequality
False sell the true meaning of love
Chests swell warning from above
Is this the kind of balance we've been dreaming of
And now we've had enough
Yeah

Cause so far there's no such thing
That is true equality
Until a new design comes to set us free
We all we all we'll

Our voice
Silence writes this song
Her choice gone and in control
Hoping that someday she'll learn to play her role
No control
No control

Write to speak i will be the next one to go
Just watch it as i fold
Yeah

Cause so far there's no such thing

That is true equality
Until a new design comes to set us free
We all will bleed

Ignorance a new disease
Prideful insecurities
Fighting to believe
So disregard the suffering
Just let the sounds of freedom ring
Through this air we breathe

All wars are created equal
All wars are created equal

Yeah we will find the answer now with one more train of hope
Yeah!

Well take heart, even though you
Are weary
And worn, clear to the bone
Just remember that you're not
Alone

You just hold on
Don't be afraid
You just hold on to the Promised
One
You just hold on
Don't be dismayed
He'll never let you down
You better hold on
You have been chosen
Just hold on to the Promised One
You better hold on
Believe in the Lord Of Love

When it seems that the trials and
Troubles of life are larger
Than you
Follow Him He will see you
Through

Don't be ashamed when your
Soul is weak
Just believe in the one you seek
The God Of Truth won't betray
You
He sent his Spirit to stay with you"

Make way for the kid to come in girl
And let me rock cause I love the way you pop that (C'mon)
Every single time we come to drop that
A lot of freaky women react to a nigga hot track (Lets go)
Then we start to cook up the place
Women watching the nigga with the ready to do the (UGH!) look on their face
(C'mon)
Freak nasty, you know the way you do it all on the guard
And the way you love to speak nasty, another freak pass me (WOO!)
Floss on, in the club ain't even got the draws on
You messing with a nigga better, stop that shit mama
In other words you better watch that shit cause you got that shit
The way your ass sit up all on your back
Its like you need to go shop that, see niggas would cock that
And definitely won't waste it
And while you at it take a lick and just taste it (taste it, taste it, taste it)

So I go low, taste the shit, taste it again I like it

Pass the last courvoisier bottle down the at bar
See a chick that kinda look like a star
And I'm saying even though I wanna to take you home girl
I know its kinda late but you ain't got to come along girl (echo)
Wait a sec you know I know a song girl
Me and you and one of your other home girls (echo)
Let me put it down and we started to bone girl
The other had a heat ""I thought ya'll be gettin' along girl?"" (echo)
Just put the pep in your step, what's with all the emotional shit
You know we be swingin' a hep
Put it on me like I wouldn't recover
Saying two chicks that was beefin' and touching and feeling each other
Word to mother, now we having a ball
The way we knockin' as the sound of the bed head smackin' the wall
Baby I'm saying I lovin' how you rubbin'
And the way that you lace it and rush it when you gettin' ready to taste it
Baby I love it, the way you rub it
And the way you lace it and rush it when you gettin' ready to taste it

Shorty hit me all on the two-way
Tell me to meet her way in the back by the couches up inside the cheetah
Then I step up in the club keep it moving wit' my hand on my heater
Stay alert and never moving the sleeper
Even though this shit was way off the meter
Couldn't believe her
Shorty buggin' and giving me head in back of the speaker
Now check it, I love the way she step to it and how she's keepin' it basic
And always be ready to taste it

in the streams of nothing going toward eternity
From a world far beyond a world of evil existence they dwell
within the light of God and await the final resurrection
Born by the rage of torment... fire
The spawn of evil shall defeat the...
liar demons of the coming judgement
Where they may wonder blood shall follow their path
driven by the vengeance from an earlier past
storms of crimson rain is bound to fall,
repent your sins cause today you die
chained to life with a fate not knowned
the ones of evil habit shall bring you down"

To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

But everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is a queer

Every time I see him he smiles 
And tells me how well he is walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually

Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain

Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer

call up a few people on the phone
yo we're havin' a party, at my private home
some bring some chronic, plus some brew
call up your girl and invite her too
come active and bring purple lactives
'cause we're gonna get more busy than gymnastics
and do the humpty hump all night
so when you come with the boy, make sure you're right
it's nine o'clock, party starts at ten

later, huh, I'll see you when you get here

Yeah, I missed a lotta lovin' in my lifetime
But I'm never gonna do it again, I'm never gonna do it again

All the girls hung around me then

Headin' for a doll serenade
Taking more than we aughta'
Shakin' off the masquerade

Lonely, she decided to see ya'
Get enough for her on the side
When the heat arrived at the motel
Whole town stayed inside

Some lie for love
Some lie for fame
Some lie for trust
Some lie in vain

Some lie for love
Some lie for gain
But I lie for you
In the pouring rain

Move on up to the Bayou
With the same old set of rules
You get nothin' for nothin'
And that's a fact
When you're tied to the ship of fools

Alice looking over her shoulder
Like a Chinese diplomat
Daring anyone to hold her
With a smile like a Cheshire cat

Some lie for love
Some lie for fame
Some lie for trust
Some lie in vain

Some lie for love
Some lie for gain
But I lie for you
In the pouring rain

Shakin' to a halt on a Voodoo
Second oldest trick in the book
No one does it quite like you do
When you start you can never
stop...never stop

On my way to a seance
Met a gypsy renegade
Crossed my palm with silver
In my heart put a jagged stake

Some lie for love
Some lie for fame
Some lie for trust
Some lie in vain

Some lie for love
Some lie for gain
But I lie for you
In the pouring rain"

Why would He let us hurt so bad?
Could anything good come of these feelings that I have?
He loved me more than the sand on beaches
He loved me more than the grass is green

That he could live his life the way he wanted to
I said my love for him had died but I know it's not true
And if I talk to him my feelings would show through
Yes if I talk to him I take him back again I'm afraid to even answer the phone
Cause if I talk to him I take him back again
So if he calls please tell him I'm not home

I tell my heart I'm better off without him now
But like the other times he change my mind somehow
He'd shed some tears and talk sweet talk I'm sure that I believe
But this time it's the end if he'll just let me be

We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
For I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone

They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it all of my heart
We may have to leave here...

This is Noise...

Down beyond these city streets through gutters filled with black debris
In alleys void of any light where nameless things live out of sight
Down through the scrapers of the sky past neon words glowing all night
Echoes my name between each car, ""Are you happy where you are?""

Blind to this impending fate
We let the world carry our weight
Its back breaks with every mile
But we all live in denial

Can we be saved? Has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine

Let's go!

And so we carry on each day as if our lives are not so grey
While every breath that we take, we only suffocate
Brush past a myriad of scenes a homeless vet crashed
On Wall Street, a single mom of three, a TV personality

I'm blind to this impending fate
They let the world carry their weight
Its back breaks with every mile
But they all live in denial

Can we be saved? Has the damage all been done?
Is it too late to reverse what we've become?
A lesson to learn at a crucial point in time
What's mine was always yours, and yours is mine

Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

Save us from what we have become tonight
Eyes glazed with distrust, no sense of wrong or right

I'm blowing up like Tom Berringer in Platoon. 
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp

who ain't down with the format

and then back up off me 
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in 
and then compare them equal boy you must be buggin 
you lucky you don't catch a slug in the chest in 
from the Smith and Wessons. 
Change the out look 
change the cover of the book 
you hip hop crook and give back what you took. 
It's the Funk coming at cha 
so don't let the crossover catch ya. 
Boy stay real. 

II.

It's on again yeah about the fake hip hop trends 
for those who can't comprehend just ask your friends 
they know the real deal of rap music no frontin 
you can't be talking loud and saying nothing 
you must be true to the game you understand 
and if not I could kill you man 
for being false plus extra fake on the tape 
talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake. 
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous cause 
I've been here since strictly business 
the era of Eric and Rakim, Biz, Public Enemy, Run-DMC, 
Houdini, The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, LL

Yes I'm back Black for those who might be confused 
and lost and don't wanna pay the cost 
of me hardcore style type a human being 
on the microphone when I be emceeing. 
Some fake the Funk and Main Source know it 
how do I know cause MTV shows it. 
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
and catching nothing but speed knots the bumbadots 
I insist we veto all fake emcees and wanna be's 
that's worst than the AIDS disease. 
So wake up Spike Lee Joint 
and don't be a knucklehead and get to the point 
with the Funk and pump up the volume 
make the wild tune to make the party boom 
peace to Redman the Rap Funkadelic 
the only emcee that's compared to Erick because I'm real."

Lookin' for the truth, they ask me where have you been?
Where have you been? Where have you been?
Getting ready for these haters, I got somethin' for them
Somethin' for them, somethin' for them

You're real quiet 'til you think you hear a sound in the wind
Sound in the wind, sound in the wind
You turn around 'cause you think you hear that sound once again
You hear that?

herido me muero si yo no te tengo,
herido a morir, herido por ti,

ay de vivir...

Dime si me quieres o si no,
déjame tranquilo te lo pido por favor
porque yo no puedo seguir así

I meant every word that I said, yeah I really did
But you gotta understand that I was sleeping then
So relax

Then every single morning I wake up and you're still there
But tomorrow you will be alone and that is all you deserve

Condition; my small town, Prognosis; let's get out

I'm more than all the cell phone towers
I'm more than all these warning baring streets
I'm more than all these small town skylines
More than they thought I'd turn out to be

Let me get this off my chest
Every bad idea I've had is starting to make sense
Feel emotionless, becoming powerless
What's left except making lists and late night double shifts

I'm more than all the cell phone towers
I'm more than all these warning baring streets
I'm more than all these small town skylines
I'm more than they thought 

It's always I want more and what I wish for
It's the never-ending cycle of always being bored
Finding an antidote for the underdog
And an anthem for the idling side

I'm more than all these warning baring streets
I'm more than all these small town skylines

This would be the last kiss

And I'm sorry isn't good enough

Made me realize
I'll be alright
How could you laugh?
How could you lie to me?
You held me close
But I couldn't feel your pain
I should've known
This couldn't last forever
The last thing I remember
Was standing all alone

No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love

The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be

The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again
Will I hold

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between 
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go

The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

The space between
Our wicked lies is
Where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Love is all we need dear

The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you

The space between
In your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time

No red ribbons in her hair
Since that Jesse's been comin' to the diner
Folks are sayin that she's never looked finer
She's got a different air

(Chorus)
She's taken a shine to him
Becomin the woman that she's never been
And all of the guys are wishin they hadn't been so blind
She's taken a shine to life
Now there's a sparkle in her eye
They all missed a gem, the diamond within
She's taken a shine

Rosie hardly ever missed a bit of work
Never took vacation days
Home or the diner it was all the same to her
She didn't know any other way
But each afternoon now she starts to come alive
Cause Jesse's there each day to pick her up at five
You oughta hear them say

Oh what a little love can do
Now that she's found herself
She's stronger than she ever knew

spend your life pushing and shoving to climb to the top
but you're held by a thread.
all the work you've don't goes to waste
because in this life you just cant get ahead.
again my world came tumbling hard upon my back.
life sifted through my hands like sand through an hourglass.

All good, all bad, all ugly
They were like brothers cause we all felt the same
The future tore them away

Born with our senses keen, hope and fear
With a sense of danger and demise
The world will numb everything, hope and fear
A negative discipline, a vacuum

What evil force dragged them down?
What demon singled them out?
What evil took them away?
Allowing only two choices

So tell me
Was there a secret never shared with others?
Was there a hidden trauma?
What made the bonds break?
What caused the mistakes?
Why was the criminal life so desired?

Born with our senses keen, hope and fear
With a sense of danger and demise
The world will numb everything, hope and fear
A negative discipline, a vacuum

From afar, bleak reports trickle in
But the world has spread apart, the world has spread apart
All the promise that was held now is wasted
The soul is delicate, the walls have crippled it
From afar, troubled lives lose their purpose
The world has given up, the world has given up
The world has finally forsaken its sons

What evil force dragged them down?
What demon singled them out?
What evil took them away?
Allowing only the choice between
Death or jail"
