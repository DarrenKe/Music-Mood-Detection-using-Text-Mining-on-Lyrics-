 Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin? sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city?
In the city?

Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love
In the city
In the city
In the city
In the city

Ain't no love Cool breeze and autumn leaves
Slow motion daylight
A lone pair of watchful eyes
Oversee the living
Feel the presence all around
A tortured soul
A wound unhealing
No regrets or promises
The past is gone
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
And go high like the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high
Hooo
Free to fly tonight
Free to fly tonight And I....

Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Baby, Im sorry. 
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl. 
I know you put all your trust
in me, I'm sorry I let you down. 
Please forgive me girl.

I'm gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe, in the spirit of love
it can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please
Come home


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again, until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee Waiting
To be born again
Wanting
The saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away

Nothing
Is what I feel
Waiting
For the drugs to make it real
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away

Waiting
To be disciplined
Aching
For your nails across my skin
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl
Waiting for the day
When I will crawl away [ VERSE 1 ]
Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lotta people already know excatly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm goin down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doin nothin but (claimin my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doublin up and provin to suckers that I can throw
I'm passin a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestylin, all the while still profilin
Never a trickster, DJ Quikster steals the show
So now that's how I'm livin
I do as I please, you see 
A younger brother that's up on reality
Cause everybody knows you have to be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton

(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised in Compton)

(Where you from, fool?) 
(Compton)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see 
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody musta wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't goin out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clocker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't gonn' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'Cpt' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively 
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win 
Cause I'm a veteran from the C-o-m-p-t-o-n 
Kick it

(Born and raised)

Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

(Born and raised in Compton)

Yo, check this shit out 
Right about now 
I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear
What's up nigga?
What's up KK?
My buddy D
We got AMG most definitely in the house
What's up Pretty Greg and Big Baby Brian cold chillin
Talkin about the Armstrong Pack
Straight got my muthafuckin back
To my buddy No Way what's up, fool
Roche is in the house
My buddy Donzelli
You know what's happenin, fool
What's up Itch
And Tony Lang is chillin
To my nigga Gangsta Wayne
And my engineer Joe gettin busy on the flo'
And last but not least I'd like to thank Shabby Blue
And we out 
Peace Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Summer's dying Master of disharmony
welcome my tainted soul
Take me from the hordes of the living
into the blessed darkness
Master of disharmony
take my impure flesh
Lead me into the path of temptation
save me from cowardness

Save me from cowardness

Master of sin
take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
for I am the damned

Master of death
take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain

Master of sin
take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
for I am the danmed

Master of death
take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain I may run and hide when you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now, there are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Looking at the crowd and I see your body sway, c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way, c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Larger than life
That's right
All of your time spent keeps us alive...

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life

Yeah, every time we're down
Yeah, you can make it right
Yeah, that's what makes you larger than life

All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality?
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger, that makes you larger
Than makes you larger than life Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti
Despedazo mi razón
Se destruye algo de mí
Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti

Cada día pienso en ti
Pienso un poco más en ti
Cada vez que sale el sol
Busco en algo el valor 
Para continuar así
Y te veo así no te toque
Rezo por ti cada noche
Amanece y pienso en ti
Y retumba en mis oídos 
El tictac de los relojes
Y sigo pensando en ti

Y sigo pensando.....

I look for a bit of valor

(C'mon, c'mon) The breath of the morning, I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement

High up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be all right
All right
I'm all right
All right

I'm just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

Uptight He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world Frozen in the place I hide
Not afraid to paint my sky with
Some who say I've lost my mind
Brother try and hope to find

You were always so far away
I know that pain so don't you run away
Like you used to do

Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can

You were always so far away
I know that pain
So I won't run away like I used to do

Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste

You were always so far away
I know the way so don't you run away
Like you used to do If I ever leave you....you can say I told you so!
And if I ever hurt you  baby..... you know I hurt myself as well.

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think I want his little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't making to much money
You know where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to  baby
And I never spent one red cent

Is that any way for a man to carry on
Do you think he  wants his little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I'm not trying to be
any kind of man
I'm trying to be somebody
You can love, trust and understand
I know that I can be

A part of you that no one else could see

I just wanna hear,a hear ya say
its allright 
yeahhh yeahhh 

only flesh and blood
But I can be everything that you demand
I can be president of general motors baby
Or just a tiny little grain of sand

Is that anyway for a man to carry on
Do you think he wants his little loved one gone
I love you baby, I love you baby
I love youMore than you'll ever know

If I ever leave you....you can say I told you so!
And if I ever hurt you ..... you know I hurt myself as well.

Is that anyway for a man to carry on
Do you think he wants his little loved one gone
I treid to tell ya I love you baby, I love you baby
yea I love you baby
I love you More than you'll ever know

I love you
I love you
I love you baby!!

I told you so many times before
I love you
I love [Chorus]
Homeboys take time and elevate your mind
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot
Homegirls inside just let your nature rise
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot

Now Gabby got the verbal that'll get your little wifey out her girdle
In a session with me lightin' up a little herbal
Turtle shell
School individuals that listen to me
Word it well
Given to the rapper who is livin to be heard and held
In a high esteem
I get you drunker than your bourbon, ale, liquor, malt, my assault learned it well
Turn the tables of time with my perception
Building staples of rhyme hear my reflections
"on a little" life I'm livin in a universe with no beginning to it
So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin into infinite subliminably spirited
A nigga with a "clip and send it rip         "
Indigenous stork has just touched ground
Rappers organizations get shut down
Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed
But rap its like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead
I be the G-I-F-T test me hefty left's be gettin' swung
Cruise like a jet ski
Up in yo apartment and plop on your couch y'all
Undisputed heavyweight lyrical southpaw

[Chorus]

It's like a lime to a lemon-that rhymes, I assemble them
At times when I'm "  " they shine you remember
"  " divine forces "  " that refine men &amp; women &amp;
I rhyme for a livin', not just for the scrilla man
That isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout
Uzi mc's I have arguments n' fallin' outs wit'
About what it's all about, ain't about foamin out the mouth
Like a walkin tall can of Guinness Stout
"        "
When the battle cries soundin'
Ding-ding, hit 'em like, bing-bing
Eat 'em like, B-King, yet wit' no seasoning-bee sting
Wich yo girl dressed in a g-string she's swingin'
My way shorty and it sure looks good
I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should
I be the jack of trades, rappers pray
That I don't decapitate, after they cash his ass
Is that an irate? Great!
Grade-A, top-choice lyricism
Hey, hit me wit' that shell shocked rhythm
One time fo' the funky rhymes I say
Two times for the beat and for my DJ
It don't stop

[Chorus]

I say we drop it on a (one), we drop it on a (two)
We comin' out (fresh), and we do it (for you)
You know the deal with Blackalicious, we don't play
(from New York, NY) (to streets of LA) to (??)
You know we leave the party wreakin' a disaster
For the new "millie", rain like a shower
Let it seep in your pores (??)
Oh lord that's [scratch]
Rock ya from the top and to the bottom (from the bottom to the top)
(cause I grab the mic) wit the intent to get ill
A natural that you know who is (still Mrs. Field's)
So slide to the side and (take it light) and (throw your hands in the air) all night (party people in the place...)
I make 'em suffer, to the fallen mc's I'd be the (quicker pickem upper) (galactic of a nebula)
I'm rappin the spectacular, attackin whack amateurs n' back stabbin salamanders
Creepin while I'm peepin on 'em (party time)
Before I used to hit the meetings it was (Thunderbird wine) (used to drink the Ole)
Now I drink Calistoga, sober and I'm older
But the world is still gettin colder (colder)
The Gift of Gab don't stop (the way I feel I have just got to rock)

[Chorus] Some day I might figure it
Right now I\'m just livin\' it
Right now I\'m just livin\' it
Right now I\'m just givin\' it

Looking out over the multitude
Looking in to the heart of it
Reaching out into the middle of it
Seeing how we\'re a part of it

Chorus:
I\'m feeling the tides of time
Moving in on my senses now
I\'m feeling the tides of time
Pull me in, pull me out

Could be in the sun setting
Might be in the rise of a storm
Could be in the morning light
Must be in the moment you\'re born

Seems like human nature
Seems like the day to day
Seemed like a big hay ride
Started us out to find our way

Unofficial verse:
So hard so beautiful
Rushing out over eternity
So long that\'s the short of it
So short that\'s the long and the tall of it Sunny came home to her favorite room
Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

She says "Days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire"

Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
And it's time for a few small repairs, she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

She says "Days go by, I don't know why 
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire"

Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it

Oh, days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire

Oh, light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own, and she's all right
Sunny came home

Sunny came home
Came home
Home I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again! I dream about, how it's gonna end
Approaching me quickly
Living a life of fear
I only want my mind to be clear

People, making fun of me
For no reason but jealousy
I fantasize about my death
I'll kill myself, from holding my breath

My suicidal dream
Voices telling me what to do
My, suicidal dream
I'm sure you will get yours too
