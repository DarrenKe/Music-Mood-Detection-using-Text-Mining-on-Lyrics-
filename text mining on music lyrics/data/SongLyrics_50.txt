 I put a spell on you 
Because you're mine 
Stop the things you do 
Watch out, I ain't lying 

I can't stand 
No running around 
I can't stand
No putting me down 

I put a spell on you 
Because you're mine, oh yeah

Stop the things you do 
Watch out, I ain't lying 

Oh, oh, I love you, I love you 
I love you anyhow 
I don't care if you don't want me 
I'm yours right now 

I put a spell on you 
Because you're mine, mine, mine 
Oh, ooh you're mine
