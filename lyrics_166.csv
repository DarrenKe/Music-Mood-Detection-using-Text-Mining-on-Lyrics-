TRAACER128F4290F96.h5,The Dillinger Escape Plan,Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants,"First off let me say you look so tired...
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky...
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight
So drop the gown the game's over just push your face into the fight and it breaks my heart like dancing up all night ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong like nothing we've ever...
Felt before

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes tonight
Baby you can have it
Baby you can have it

Ooh baby gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star...

Of my every last show
Let's go for a long ride I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
The stranger's candy, broken alleys

We're missing in action living in a time when it's in fashion
To be gun flashing, blasting that's why we ain't lasting
All fastened, strapped ready for rivals harassing
Looking over your shoulder ducking cars that are passing
In my rumbo you hear that latin lingo
Guns shoot through at pachucos fuckin? sickos
With four nickels nobody walks around single
Get caught slipping they'll pull your card from a window
It's that simple locals get gaffled by barrio locos
Steal their spanish grease making them shed a tear like willie bobo
Over dollars, chains and rings things that are worth poco
A coco's out there stealing 'cause they're fiending for perico
A head crack will strike and attack for a sack
Pawn or sell your shit to buy a rock and bring that high back
That's why I strap it's my defense against those
Who are committing defense randomly becoming foes?
Shit is survival of fittest testing who's biggest and realest on the street
Feel this beware of killers, stealers and dealers
Rebel guerillas striking on policemen who give us
Hard times in the city where no love is with us

Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall

Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge

Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks

To unearth my earning potential

I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was ""Spaz"", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
""I should have one last party at my place...""
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
""You're invited to my House Destruction Party!""

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, ""I wanna speak to someone who lives here!"" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, ""Is this the condition the house has always been in?""
She answered, ""Uh... yeah, it is.""

Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?

What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?

Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the

stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.

Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see

I should have said, ""No, someone's waiting for me...""

""Listen baby, I'm sorry

I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one

Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like ""Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, ""Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh

Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Spoken
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.

Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door

TRAKPND128F42389EA.h5,Phil Collins,You Can't Hurry Love  (LP Version),"I need love, love to ease my mind
I need to find time
Someone to call mine
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes

But how many heartaches must I stand
Before I find a love to let me live again
Right now the only thing
That keeps me hangin' on
When I feel my strength
Ooh, it's almost gone
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait
How much more can I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

Now I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hangin' on
I remember mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust on my good times
No matter how long it takes
(Well now wait)

No love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waitin'
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
Keep on waitin'
Until that day
But it ain't easy yeah
It ain't easy
But mama said

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take

You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take",1,0
TRAKQXJ128F147A028.h5,AFI,Summer Shudder,"Listen when I say, when I say it's real
Real life goes undefined, why must you be so missable?
Everything you take makes me more unreal
Real lines are undefined, how can this be so miserable?

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away

Listen, I can't make, make a sound or feel
Feel fine, I kissed the lies, why must they be so kissable?
Listen as I break, break the fourth wall's seal
Gorgeous eyes shine suicide, when will we be invisible?

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
We burned away

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away

This is the fall, this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small
This is the fall, this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small

Under the summer rain, burn
We burned away

Will always be the head conerstone
The stone that the builder refused
Will always be the head cornerstone

You're a builder, oh, la di la
Here I am a stone
Don't you think and refuse me
Cause the things people refuse
Are the things they should refuse
Do you hear me, hear what I say

The stone taht the builder refused
Will always be the head conerstone
The stone that the builder refused
Will always be the head cornerstone

Anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you

'Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

More attached to you when
You hold me in your arms and squeeze me
And you leave me, makin' me blue

TRAKXMS12903CB36F2.h5,DAVE MATTHEWS BAND,The Space Between,"There's no hope in you for me
No corner you could squeeze me
But I got all the time for you love

The space between
The tears we cry...
Is the laughter that keeps us coming back for more
The space between...
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again

These fickle fuddled words confuse me
Like will it rain today
We waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild eyed beast you be

The space between
The wicked lies we tell and hope to keep safe from the pain

But will I hold you again
Will I hold

Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like the devil in the church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

The space between 
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go

The space between
The bullets in our fire fight
Is where I'll be hiding waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room

The space between
Our wicked lies is
Where we hope to keep safe from pain

Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Right out of here
Love is all we need dear

The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding
Waiting for you

The space between
In your heart and mine
Is the space we'll fill with time

The space between",1,2001
